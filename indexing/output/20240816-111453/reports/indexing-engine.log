Significant warming has intensified the threat to social and economic sustainability (medium confidence). Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of the threat of heatwaves across Asia, droughts in arid and semi-arid areas of West, Central, and South Asia, delays and weakening of the monsoon circulation in South Asia, floods in monsoon regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia, and glacier melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (medium confidence). {10.3.1, 10.3.3}\n\nAsian countries are experiencing a hotter summer climate, resulting in an increase in energy demand for cooling at a rapid rate, together with population growth (high confidence). Decrease in precipitation influences energy demand as well as desalination, underground water pumping, and other energy-intensive methods increasingly used for water supply (high confidence). More energy demands in summer seasons will exceed any energy savings from relatively lower heating demand due to warmer winters. Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high-energy insecurity and industrial-systems risk (high confidence). {10.4.1}\n\nAsian terrestrial ecosystems change is driven by global warming, precipitation, and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing, and extreme events like dust storms, along with natural and human-related factors which interact (high confidence). Treeline position in North Asian mountains moved upwards after the 1990s, while in the Himalaya, treeline demonstrates a multi-directional shift\u2014either moving upwards, showing no upslope advance, or moving downwards. This can be explained by site-specific complex interactions of the positive effect of warming on tree growth, drought stress, changes in snow precipitation, land-use change (especially grazing), and other factors (high confidence). The considerable changes in biomes in Asia are a response to warming (medium confidence). Terrestrial and freshwater species, populations, and communities are altered in line with climate change across Asia (medium to high confidence). Climate change, human activity, and lightning have caused the increase in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia after the 1990s (medium confidence). Length of plant growth season has increased in some parts of East and North Asia, while the opposite trend, or no change at all, has been observed in other parts (high confidence). Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence).","chunk_id":"b61a22212865c744b92b2f734a80c931","document_ids":["5a17ca0063b3e7e0d54f197b1e67d7ff"],"n_tokens":512}

Significant warming has intensified the threat to social and economic sustainability (medium confidence). Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of the threat of heatwaves across Asia, droughts in arid and semi-arid areas of West, Central, and South Asia, delays and weakening of the monsoon circulation in South Asia, floods in monsoon regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia, and glacier melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (medium confidence). {10.3.1, 10.3.3}\n\nAsian countries are experiencing a hotter summer climate, resulting in an increase in energy demand for cooling at a rapid rate, together with population growth (high confidence). Decrease in precipitation influences energy demand as well as desalination, underground water pumping, and other energy-intensive methods increasingly used for water supply (high confidence). More energy demands in summer seasons will exceed any energy savings from relatively lower heating demand due to warmer winters. Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high-energy insecurity and industrial-systems risk (high confidence). {10.4.1}\n\nAsian terrestrial ecosystems change is driven by global warming, precipitation, and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing, and extreme events like dust storms, along with natural and human-related factors which interact (high confidence). Treeline position in North Asian mountains moved upwards after the 1990s, while in the Himalaya, treeline demonstrates a multi-directional shift—either moving upwards, showing no upslope advance, or moving downwards. This can be explained by site-specific complex interactions of the positive effect of warming on tree growth, drought stress, changes in snow precipitation, land-use change (especially grazing), and other factors (high confidence). The considerable changes in biomes in Asia are a response to warming (medium confidence). Terrestrial and freshwater species, populations, and communities are altered in line with climate change across Asia (medium to high confidence). Climate change, human activity, and lightning have caused the increase in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia after the 1990s (medium confidence). Length of plant growth season has increased in some parts of East and North Asia, while the opposite trend, or no change at all, has been observed in other parts (high confidence). Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence).\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence). There is evidence that climate change can alter species interaction or spatial distribution of invasive species in Asia (high confidence). Changes in ecosystems in Asia during the 21st century are expected to be driven by projected climatic, natural, and socioeconomic changes. Across Asia, under a range of representative concentration pathways and other scenarios, rising temperatures are expected to contribute to a northward shift of biome boundaries and an upwards shift of mountain treeline (medium confidence). {10.4.2}\n\nIn this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and is typeset in italics (e.g., medium confidence). For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence.\n\nCoastal habitats of Asia are diverse, and the impacts of climate change—including rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise (SLR)—have brought negative effects to the services and the livelihoods of people dependent on them (high confidence). The degree of bleaching of coral reefs is diverse among different presences of stress-tolerant symbionts and higher thermal thresholds. The risk of irreversible loss of coral reefs, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, plankton communities, and other marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C temperature rise or more (high confidence). Mangroves in the region continue to face threats due to pollution, conversion for aquaculture and agriculture, and climate-based threats like SLR and coastal erosion. {10.4.3}\n\nBoth climatic and non-climatic drivers such as socioeconomic changes have created water stress conditions in both water supply and demand in all sub-regions of Asia, except for North Asia (medium confidence).

Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7–9]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings. These studies have shown ran\n\nthat adhesion is mainly (if not entirely) due to van der Waals forces, as the extremely small tips s.R\n\n(spatulae ca. 200 nm wide and 5–20 nm thick) of the highly branched adhesive setae (hairs) on\n\n.So\n\nthe toe pads of geckos are able to achieve extremely close contact with the surface to which the c.A\n\ngecko is adhering. A number of gecko-inspired adhesive structures have been designed and some 377\n\ncan support the weight of a human [12]. However, such gecko-inspired structures are difficult to\n\n:20190131\n\nmimic and their durability is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe adhesion mechanism of tree and torrent frogs is quite different, which means the biomimetic applications arising from it will differ from those developed from geckos. As will be described in this review, tree frogs mainly adhere by wet adhesion, as there is a thin layer of fluid between the toe pad and the adhering substrate. The adhesive forces are thought to be capillarity and viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces [13–15], but a role for van der Waals forces cannot be excluded [16]. Tree frog toe pads also generate friction forces; indeed, maximum friction forces may exceed those arising from adhesion [17,18]. As we shall describe, the tree frog’s adhesive mechanism provides good adhesion and friction on soft wet surfaces, and, as a result, is likely to have many important applications, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nA significant body of work has also been carried out on insects. Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues.

Tree/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21].

This frog 7:2\n\nhas just landed on a bamboo stem, and has slipped downwards, leaving behind some of the watery fluid that forms its adhesive 0190131\n\njoint ( b) (Allan L, 2013, personal communication).\n\nthe ventral surface of the toes (toe pads), with related structures (sub-articular tubercles) being located on the ventral surface of more proximal digits. The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 µm diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E ≈ 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

As described below, they are mainly hexagonal in shape and are surrounded by deep, fluid-filled channels (figure 2 c). These channels are thought to serve two functions. First, they help spread the fluid over the entire pad surface, so that there are no air pockets that would reduce adhesion. Second, under wet conditions, they would help to get rid of excess fluid which would reduce adhesion by increasing the separation of pad and surface.

There are thus two sets of structures (the cells separated by grooves and the nanopillars) that allow the pad to keep close contact to rough as well as smooth surfaces, promoting both adhesion and friction forces.\n\nThe watery pad fluid has a viscosity of 1.25–1.51 mPa s−1. Using a laser tweezer technique, Federle et al. [23] have shown that the fluid secreted by the toe pads has a low viscosity in the range 1.25–1.51 mPa s−1 (figure 5). It is usually referred to as mucus, but detailed chemistry remains to be identified. It is secreted by glands within the toes and passes to the pad surface through narrow ducts which open into the grooves that separate the pad epithelial cells. It completely fills the space below the pad and forms a meniscus around the edge of the pad, producing capillary forces [14, 32]. The fluid is, however, known to contain molecules that act as surfactants Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\n[33], lowering surface tension and thus allowing capillary adhesion to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. surfaces of waxy leaves).\n\nThe fluid layer below each epithelial cell has a thickness of the order of a few nanometres. Federle et al.\n\n[23], using interference reflection microscopy, have shown that the fluid under the toe pads has a low thickness, except around the edges of the epithelial cells, where the channels between the epithelial cells are located (figure 6). This means that, in addition to capillary forces, substantial velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces will be present [34]. Indeed, torrent frogs can adhere in running water when the pads are completely submerged, a situation where capillary forces would be absent [35,36].\n\nTree frog toe pads produce higher friction than adhesive forces, a surprising finding for a fluid joint.\n\nFederle et al. [23] have shown that it is due to the nanopillars, which form extremely close contact with the external surface (in the range 0–5 nm (figure 6 d)). Nanopillars cover the surface of all the pad epithelial cells (figures 2 and 4), but are absent from other, non-adhesive areas\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

A common model that has been used for quantifying capillary forces consists of a sphere on a plane surface, connected by a drop of liquid (figure 7). In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = −2 πRγ (cos θ 1 + cos θ 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, γ is the surface tension of the liquid, and θ 1 and θ 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. θ 1 and θ 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = −4 πRγ .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8).

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2. It is negligible for high Young’s moduli, but becomes significant for soft materials.\n\nπγ 3\n\nFL = −4 πrγ −\n\n· 2 r 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 r\n\n3( E eff)2\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus.\n\n10\n\nWet adhesion—viscous forces.

Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14].

Since frogs have an area-based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]\n\ndemonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n11\n\n)2\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oya\n\n10\n\n100\n\nlsociet\n\nypublishing\n\nmass (g\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Both friction and adhesion components of the resultant force are shown for a 70° pull-off, which followed a short initial slide, designed to ensure good initial contact of pad and force plate. A drop of water was then gently added, covering the pad in such a way that the meniscus around the edge of the pad was abolished. As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad–ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n‘remaining’ friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 ± 1.14 mN mm−2 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 ± 5.11 mN mm−2 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al.

CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm−2, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads,\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads, the pillar tops are never smooth. As described above, concave nanostructures have been found on the toe pads of tree frogs (figure 4), and peg-structures have also been reported in bush-crickets [56]. Li et al.

( a, b) reproduced from Greiner et al. [52]; ( c, d) are reproduced from Wang et al. [53].\n\nmicro-bulges on pillar top prepared by combining hemispheric crater arrays on SiO2 wafer and conventional photolithography. The increased friction force of this hierarchical hexagonal structure, especially in the hydrophilic state, demonstrated the importance of nanostructures on toe pads of tree frogs (figure 14 b). Moreover, concave, spatular, T-shape and spherical micropillar tops were also constructed to investigate the adhesion properties. T-shape pillars, prepared by conventional moulding [59] and inking–printing–curing (IPC) methods, exhibited maximum adhesion strength, both in wet [60] and dry [48, 61] conditions. Both the higher compliance and comparatively large contact area contribute to the outstanding performance. Furthermore, the crack initiation tends to start from the centre during the detachment [62], which results in a suction effect, contributing positively to the adhesion [59].\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\n(b) Influences of micro- and nanostructure\n\nInspired by the existence of nanopillars in toe pad of tree frogs, we fabricated a composite structure with aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars embedded in soft PDMS hexagonal micropillars [63]. Both adhesion and friction forces were greatly enhanced compared to the structure with pure PDMS. The finite-element simulation suggests that the embedded nanopillars could regulate the stress distribution across the contact interface, with the stress maximum being distributed on top of a row of nanopillars close to the micropillar perimeter (but not at the centre of contact area or at the very edge of the pillar; figure 14 d). This is similar to the T-shape pillars inspired by gecko setae, which can also shift the stress maximum to the centre of the contact area, inhibiting the crack initiation during pulling. However, the composite structure should possess a much higher stability and durability since the nanopillars are embedded.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n( b)\n\n( a)\n\nhydrophobic\n\n15\n\nhydrophilic\n\nload: in; flood\n\nr\n\n1.0\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 0.5\n\nypublishing\n\nfriction force\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

[71].\n\nPhil.T\n\nby the surface wettability [35, 60]. By applying glycerol (which is polar and does not evaporate ran\n\nat room temperature) to the interface, the adhesion of structured PDMS against a ruby sphere s.R\n\nwas evaluated [60]. It was found that, in the main, short-range attractive forces dominate\n\n.So\n\nadhesion when the PDMS surface is hydrophobic, as the glycerol may be squeezed out from c.A37\n\nthe contact area forming direct contacts. It therefore behaves like gecko-inspired structured 7\n\nadhesive, showing a strong dependence on the contact geometry [60]. By contrast, long-range\n\n:20190131\n\nattractive forces associated with capillarity dominate when the surface is hydrophilic. In this situation, capillary force dominates the adhesion strength, independent of the microstructures on the surface. It was suggested that the adhesion enhancement in the presence of fluid could be the result of crack arresting by liquid, in addition to the capillary forces [69]. It should be noted that excessive liquid will produce a lubrication region, leading to a reduction in adhesion and friction [69,70]. Since the surface wettability has a strong influence on wet adhesion, the switching of a surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic, e.g. by temperature, could therefore regulate the wet adhesion. By coating a layer of temperature responsive copolymer poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl acrylate-co-isopropyl acrylamide) (p(DMA-co-MEA-coNIPAAm) on PDMS micropillars, switching of underwater adhesion was successfully achieved by simply adjusting the temperature of the water bath (figure 15 b) [71].\n\nThe microstructure of the toe pads of animals like tree frogs is considered to play a very important role in wet adhesion. It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid–solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid–solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72,73]. Due to the polygonal nature of frog-inspired micropatterns, shear adhesion (friction) shows orientation dependence. In our previous work, wet friction was found to be the highest along the direction of side-sliding (figure 16 a) [55]. Moreover, elongated hexagonal micropillars show an even higher friction at the same orientation. The effective arresting of cracks increases following the edge density per unit length along the friction direction, contributing to friction Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nenhancement. The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].

This means that capillary force may serve as the major contributor to wet adhesion on a rough surface [77]. Moreover, structured adhesives could effectively slow down the evaporation of liquid on the rough substrates, which is quite important for tree frogs and other animals using wet adhesion in their natural environment [38].\n\nWhile most studies of wet adhesion on artificial materials involved coating a thin layer of liquid on the structured surface, a few reported the delivery of liquid to the contact area mimicking the secretion of animals [49, 80]. Making use of the microphase separation of block copolymer poly(styrene- b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS2VP), nanopillars with 98 nm internal channels were designed to deliver liquid to the contact area, mimicking the dynamic secretion of animals.\n\nThe combination of material softening in high humidity and the transportation of mineral oil to the contact interface greatly increased the adhesion force by two orders of magnitude.

Interestingly, Vogel et al. [80] have designed a device with a plate full of holes. Water can be pumped into the holes via channels beneath the plate and form droplet arrays on the plate (figure 17 a). Each droplet can therefore form a liquid bridge with a contacting surface, creating an adhesion force at the interface. Indeed, with all the liquid droplets acting together, the device can generate a substantial adhesion force.\n\n4. Applications\n\nAlthough the mimicking of tree frog-inspired wet adhesion is still in its infancy, there are already some attempts to make use of it in the area of bionic robots [81], soft tissue engineering [82], etc.\n\nFor instance, Tsipenyuk prepared a variety of polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) hexagonal patterns as the stretching unit for disposable safety razors [82].

Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74].

Though the modes of variability discussed here are assessed and classified on the basis of physical variables, it is important to recognize that the distribution and function of various components of the terrestrial and marine biospheres are modified in response to them.\n\n2.4.1 Annular Modes\n2.4.1.1 Northern Annular Mode (NAM)/North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)\nThe AR5 reported that the shift towards a positive NAO, a mode of variability in the North Atlantic that is closely related to the hemispheric-scale NAM, from the 1950s to the 1990s was largely reversed by more recent changes (high confidence). Moreover, periods of persistent negative or positive NAO states observed during the latter part of the 20th century were not unusual, based on NAO reconstructions spanning the last half millennium (high confidence).\n\nNew multi-millennial-timescale NAO reconstructions are derived from marine and lake sediments, speleothems, tree rings and ice cores (Ortega et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Sjolte et al., 2018). NAO variability over the past 8 kyr suggests the presence of a significant 1.5 kyr periodicity (Darby et al., 2012). Positive NAO conditions dominated during the MH, while the prevailing NAO sign during the early and late Holocene was negative according to most reconstructions (Olsen et al., 2012; Ait Brahim et al., 2019; Røthe et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, reconstructions developed since AR5 indicate no dominant NAO phase during 1000–1300 CE (Jones et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2015; Ortega et al., 2015; Lasher and Axford, 2019; Hernández et al., 2020), with either negative (Baker et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019) or a more variable phase of the NAO (Jones et al., 2014; Ortega et al.,\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Several instrument-based NAO reconstructions extending back to the 17th and 18th centuries highlight the presence of multi-decadal variations in the NAO phases (Cornes et al., 2013; Cropper et al., 2015), although these studies have limitations considering the seasonality of the centres of action and the locations of the stations used. Recent reconstructions of the large scale sea level pressure field yield more robust NAO analysis, showing a persistently negative NAO phase from the 1820s to the 1870s, with positive values dominating during the beginning of the 20th century followed by a declining trend over 1920–1970, with a recovery thereafter to a period of consistently high values between 1970 and the early 1990s (Delaygue et al., 2019; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019). Based on the evaluation of several NAO reconstructions for recent centuries, Hernández et al. (2020) highlighted that the strong positive NAO phases of the 1990s and early 21st century were not unusual.\n\nThe predominantly positive phase during the 1990s was followed by partial reversal and a tendency towards stronger variability in boreal winter NAM and NAO since the late 1990s (Pinto and Raible, 2012; Hanna et al., 2018). This is particularly evident in December NAO (Hanna et al., 2015) and NAM (Overland and Wang, 2015) indices, and is not unusual on multi-decadal time scales (Woollings et al., 2018a). Since the 1990s, a statistically significant summer NAO decline was reported, which is, to a lesser extent, also evident in the winter NAO, linked to an enhanced blocking activity over Greenland (Hanna et al., 2015, 2016; Wachowicz et al., 2021).

However, this was moderated by persistent positive NAO values since 2015 (Annex IV.2.1). Based on observations and reanalysis datasets, multi-decadal variations were found for the NAM patterns: the Atlantic centre remained unchanged throughout 1920–2010, whereas the Pacific centre was stronger during 1920–1959 and 1986–2010 and weaker during 1960–1985 (Gong et al., 2018). Multidecadal changes were also observed in the position of the centres of action of the NAO (Moore et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2016).\n\nIn summary, positive trends for the NAM/NAO winter indices were observed between the 1960s and the early 1990s, but these indices have become less positive or even negative thereafter (high confidence). The NAO variability in the instrumental record was very likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial context.\n\n2.4.1.2 Southern Annular Mode (SAM)\nThe AR5 concluded that it was likely that the SAM had become more positive since the 1950s and that this increase was unusual in the context of the prior 400 years (medium confidence). Both AR5 and SROCC reported statistically significant trends in the SAM during the instrumental period for the austral summer and autumn.\n\nSeveral studies have attempted to reconstruct the evolution of the SAM during the Holocene using proxies of the position and strength of the SH zonal winds, although with no clear consensus regarding the timing and phase of the SAM (Hernández et al., 2020). The early Holocene was dominated by SAM positive phases (Moreno et al., 2018; Reynhout et al., 2019), consistent with increasing westerly wind strength (Lamy et al., 2010), with some reconstructions showing significant centennial and millennial variability but no consistent trend after 5 ka (Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, enhanced westerly winds occurred over 0–1000 CE, as reflected in increased burning activity in Patagonia (Turney et al., 2016a) and\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

For the CE, enhanced westerly winds occurred over 0–1000 CE, as reflected in increased burning activity in Patagonia (Turney et al., 2016a) and tree ring records from southern New Zealand (Turney et al., 2016b) imply a predominantly positive SAM phase. Pollen records and lake sediments from Tasmania, southern mainland Australia, New Zealand and southern South America, inferred the period of 1000 to 1400 CE to be characterized by anomalously dry conditions south of 40°S, implying a positive SAM (Moreno et al., 2014; Fletcher et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019; Matley et al., 2020). Nevertheless, proxy reconstructions of the SAM based on temperature-sensitive records from tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals spanning the mid-to-polar latitudes show alternating positive and negative phases (Figure 2.35).\nFigure 2.35 | Southern Annular Mode (SAM) reconstruction over the last millennium.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1).\n\nProlonged periods of negative SAM values were identified during the period 1400–1700 CE in several reconstructions (Figure 2.35, Villalba et al., 2012; Abram et al., 2014; Dätwyler et al., 2018), with a minimum identified during the 15th century (Hernández et al., 2020), although some disagreements exist between proxy records before 1800 CE (Hessl et al., 2017). Abram et al. (2014) concluded that the mean SAM index during recent decades is at its highest levels for at least the last 1 kyr. Similarly, the summer SAM reconstruction by Dätwyler et al. (2018) indicates a strengthening over the last 60 years that is outside the very likely range of the last millennium natural variability.

(2018) indicates a strengthening over the last 60 years that is outside the very likely range of the last millennium natural variability. The largest 30- and 50-year trends in the annual SAM index occurred at the end of the 20th century (after 1969 and 1950 respectively), indicating that the recent increase in the SAM is unprecedented in the context of at least the past three centuries (Yang and Xiao, 2018).\n\nBefore the mid-1950s, SAM indices derived from station-based datasets, and centennial reanalyses show pronounced interannual and decadal variability but no significant trends, with low correlation between SAM indices due to the diversity across different datasets and sensitivity to the definition used for the index calculation (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019). Various SAM indices exhibit significant positive trends since the 1950s, particularly during austral summer and autumn (Barrucand et al., 2018; Schneider and Fogt, 2018; J. Lee et al., 2019), unprecedented for austral summer over the last 150 years (J.M. Jones et al., 2016; Fogt and Marshall, 2020). This indicates a strengthening of the surface westerly winds around Antarctica, related to both the position and intensity of the subpolar jet in the SH (Section 2.3.1.4.3; Ivy et al., 2017; IPCC, 2019). The SAM trends have slightly weakened after about 2000 (Fogt and Marshall, 2020).\n\nIn summary, historical station-based reconstructions of the SAM show that there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM index, particularly since 1950 and for the austral summer (high confidence). The recent positive trend in the SAM is likely unprecedented in at least the past millennium, although medium confidence arises due to the differences between proxy records before 1800 CE.\n\n2.4.2 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nThe AR5 reported with medium confidence that ENSO-like variability existed, at least sporadically, during the warm background state of the Pliocene. It was also found (high confidence) that ENSO has remained highly variable during the last 7 kyr with no discernible orbital modulation.

It was also found (high confidence) that ENSO has remained highly variable during the last 7 kyr with no discernible orbital modulation. The AR5 concluded that large variability on interannual to decadal timescales, and differences between datasets, precluded robust conclusions on any changes in ENSO during the instrumental period. The SROCC reported epochs of strong ENSO variability throughout the Holocene, with no indications of a systematic trend in ENSO amplitude, but with some indication that the ENSO amplitude over 1979–2009 was greater than at any point in the period from 1590–1880 CE. It was also reported that the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the period from 1951–2000 was high relative to 1901–1950.\n\nManucharyan and Fedorov (2014) found that ENSO-like variability has been present, at least sporadically, during epochs of millions of years (including the MPWP; Cross-Chapter Box 2.4), with proxy records indicating that this was the case even when cross-Pacific SST gradients were much weaker than present. There is substantial disagreement between proxy records for ENSO activity during the early Holocene (Zhang et al., 2014; White et al., 2018), and for ENSO activity and mean state at the LGM (Leduc et al., 2009; Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Sadekov et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2015, 2018; Zhu et al., 2017; Tierney et al., 2020). A number of studies (Cobb et al., 2013; H. McGregor et al., 2013; Carré et al., 2014; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2017; White et al., 2018; Grothe et al., 2019) have found that ENSO was substantially weaker than at present at various times in the mid-Holocene within the period from 6 to 3 ka, with stronger decreases in variability revealed by remote proxies than by those close to the core region of ENSO activity.

However, Karamperidou et al. (2015) find that weakening in ENSO-related variability in eastern Pacific proxies does not necessarily correspond to weakening in central Pacific proxies. Barrett et al. (2018) concluded that multi-proxy reconstructions are more efficient at identifying eastern Pacific than central Pacific events. This suggests that a weakening of proxy-based signals may indicate an along-equatorial shift in ENSO activity rather than a weakening of ENSO during some periods. Following the period of weak ENSO variability in the mid-Holocene, a number of studies find an increase in ENSO activity which, depending upon the study, commences between 4.4 and 3 ka (Koutavas and Joanides, 2012; Cobb et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014; S. Chen et al., 2016; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021).\n\nNumerous studies (J. Li et al., 2013; S. McGregor et al., 2013; Rustic et al., 2015; Hope et al., 2017; Y. Liu et al., 2017) find substantial variability in ENSO activity on multi-decadal to centennial timescales over the last 500 to 1 kyr (Figure 2.36). Different proxies show a wide spread in the specific timing and magnitude of events in the pre-instrumental period (e.g., Dätwyler et al., 2019). Most investigators find that ENSO activity in recent decades was higher than the most recent centuries prior to the instrumental period. Grothe et al. (2019) also found that ENSO variance of the last 50 years was 25% higher than the average of the last millennium, and was substantially higher than the average of the mid- to late-Holocene. S. McGregor et al., (2010, 2013) looked for common variance changes in pre-existing ENSO proxies, finding stronger ENSO variance for the 30-year period 1979–2009\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

S. McGregor et al., (2010, 2013) looked for common variance changes in pre-existing ENSO proxies, finding stronger ENSO variance for the 30-year period 1979–2009 compared to any 30-year period within the timespan 1590–1880 CE. This finding also holds when adding more recently developed ENSO proxies (Figure 2.36). Koutavas and Joanides (2012), Ledru et al. (2013) and Thompson et al. (2017) identify various periods within the range 1000 BCE to 1300 CE when ENSO activity was greater than in the following centuries, and more closely comparable to the mid-20th century onwards behaviour.\nFigure 2.36 | Reconstructed and historical variance ratio of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). (a) 30-year running variance of the reconstructed annual mean Niño 3.4 or related indicators from various published reconstructions. (b) Variance of June–November Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and April–March mean Niño 3.4 (1981–2010 base period) along with the mean reconstruction from (a). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1).\n\nSince AR5, updates to datasets used widely in prior ENSO assessments resulted in substantial and important revisions to observed tropical Pacific SST data (Section 2.3.1.1). In particular, ERSSTv4, and then ERSSTv5, addressed known SST biases in ERSSTv3 in the equatorial Pacific which affected the derived mean state and amplitude of indices based on that dataset (Huang et al., 2015). During the instrumental period, there is no robust indication of any significant century-scale trend in the east-west SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with periods when gradients have been stronger and weaker than the long-term average on decadal timescales, associated with a predominance of La Niña or El Niño events respectively. The frequency of El Niño and La Niña events is also subject to considerable decadal variability (e.g., Hu et al., 2013) but with no indication of a long-term signal in the frequency of events.

The frequency of El Niño and La Niña events is also subject to considerable decadal variability (e.g., Hu et al., 2013) but with no indication of a long-term signal in the frequency of events. The ENSO amplitude since 1950 has increased relative to the 1910–1950 period, as confirmed by independent proxy records (e.g., Gergis and Fowler, 2009), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (Braganza et al., 2009) and SSTs (e.g., Ohba, 2013; Yu and Kim, 2013), although there is a spread between different proxy and instrumental sources as to the magnitude of that increase (Figure 2.36). The El Niño events of 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 had the strongest anomalies in the Niño 3.4 SST index since 1950. Their predominance was less evident from indices based on de-trended data such as the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) (which still ranked them as the three strongest events since 1950, but only by a small margin), and in the SOI. B. Huang et al. (2019a) also note that analyses based upon buoy and Argo data, which are only available since the 1990s, are more capable of resolving strong events than analyses which do not include such data.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, SST observations in the tropical Pacific were much sparser and hence uncertainties in Niño indices are much larger (B. Huang et al., 2020). SOI data and some newer SST-based studies show high ENSO amplitude, comparable to the post-1950 period, in the period from the mid-late 19th century to about 1910, but proxy indicators generally indicate that the late 19th and early 20th century were less active than the late 20th century (Figure 2.36). Yu and Kim’s (2013) implementation of the ONI found a number of events with the ONI above 1.5°C between 1888 and 1905, then no such events until 1972, whilst the SOI indicates comparable or stronger events to the three strongest post-1950 events in 1896 and 1905.

Giese and Ray (2011) also found a number of such events between 1890 and 1920 in the SODA ocean reanalysis, corroborated further by B. Huang et al. (2020) and Vaccaro et al. (2021), who found that the strength of the 1877–1878 event was comparable with that of the 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 events. There have also been a number of strong La Niña events (e.g., 1973–1974, 1975–1976 and 2010–2011), with few clear analogues in the 1920–1970 period; the proxy-based analysis of McGregor et al. (2010) indicates that the mid-1970s La Niña period was also extreme in a multi-centennial context. There is no indication that the frequency of high-amplitude events since the 1970s reflects a long-term trend which can be separated from multi-decadal variability, given apparent presence of several high-amplitude events in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the relatively large uncertainty in pre-1950 SST data in the tropical Pacific region.\n\nThere is a distinction (Annex IV.2.3.1) between El Niño events centred in the eastern Pacific (‘Eastern Pacific’ (EP) or ‘classical’ events) and those centred in the Central Pacific (‘Central Pacific’ (CP) or ‘Modoki’ events), which have different typical teleconnections (e.g., Ashok et al., 2007; Ratnam et al., 2014; Capotondi et al., 2015; Timmermann et al., 2018). A number of studies, using a range of indicators, have found an increase in recent decades of the fraction of CP El Niño events, particularly after 2000 (Yu and Kim, 2013; Lübbecke and McPhaden, 2014; Pascolini-Campbell et al., 2015; Jiang and Zhu, 2018).

Johnson (2013) found that the frequency of CP El Niño events had increased (although not significantly) over the 1950–2011 period, being accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of La Niña events with a warm (as opposed to cool) western Pacific warm pool. A coral-based reconstruction starting in 1600 CE (Freund et al., 2019) found that the ratio of CP to EP events in the last 30 years was substantially higher than at any other time over the last 400 years. Variations in the proportion of CP and EP events have also been found in earlier periods, with Carré et al. (2014) finding a period of high CP activity around 7 ka.\n\nThere is no robust indicationof any changes in ENSO teleconnections over multi-centennial timescales (Hernández et al., 2020) despite multi-decadal variability. Shi and Wang (2018) found that teleconnections with the broader Asian summer monsoon, including the Indian and the East Asian monsoon, were generally stable since the 17th century during the developing phase of the monsoon, and showed substantial decadal variability, but no clear trend, during the decaying phase. They also found that the weakening of teleconnections between the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO in recent decades had numerous precedents over the last few centuries. Räsänen et al. (2016) also found substantial decadal variability, but little trend, in the strength of the relationship between ENSO and monsoon precipitation in South East Asia between 1650 and 2000. Dätwyler et al. (2019) identified a number of multi-decadal periods with apparently changed teleconnections at times over the last 400 years.\n\nIn the instrumental period, teleconnections associated with ENSO are well known to vary on decadal to multi-decadal timescales (e.g., He et al., 2013; Lee and Ha, 2015; Ashcroft et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019).

Yun and Timmermann (2018) found that decadal variations in teleconnections between ENSO and the Indian monsoon did not extend beyond what would be expected from a stochastic process. Many observed decadal changes in teleconnections in the instrumental period are consistent with a shift to more central Pacific El Niño events (Evtushevsky et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2018; Yu and Sun, 2018; Zhao and Wang, 2019). Effects of the PDV (Kwon et al., 2013; S. Wang et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2018) and the AMV (Kayano et al., 2019) can also modulate ENSO teleconnections, and affect the frequency of CP versus EP events (Ashok et al., 2007). Chiodi and Harrison (2015) found that teleconnections over the most recent decades are broadly consistent with those over the last 100 years. Variability in teleconnections can also occur on timescales longer than characteristic PDV timescales (e.g., Gallant et al., 2013).\n\nIn summary, there is medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 are higher than over the period from 1850 and possibly as far back as 1400, but low confidence that they are outside the range of variability over periods prior to 1400, or higher than the average of the Holocene as a whole. Overall, there is no indication of a recent sustained shift in ENSO or associated features such as the Walker Circulation, or in teleconnections associated with these, being beyond the range of variability on decadal to millennial timescales. A high proportion of El Niño events in the last 20–30 years have been based in the central, rather than eastern Pacific, but there is low confidence that this represents a long-term change.\n\n2.4.3 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes\nThe AR5 did not provide an assessment of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) records based on paleo reconstructions.

For the instrumental era, AR5 reported that there were no trends in the IOD behaviour. However, the strength of the Indian Ocean Basin-wide (IOB) mode, quantified by the basin-scale averaged SST index, increased in all assessed periods except 1979–2012, but the AR5 neither quantified trends nor provided a confidence statement.\n\nFor the LGM, enhanced equatorial Indian Ocean productivity in marine sediment records was associated with strengthened westerly jets, in line with a shallower central-western Indian Ocean thermocline and stronger negative IOD events (Punyu et al., 2014). The LGM Indian Ocean basin was substantially modified by the exposure of the tropical shelves (DiNezio et al., 2018) and this has been associated with an Indian Ocean ‘El Niño‘ (Thirumalai et al., 2019). Wurtzel et al. (2018) contend that during the LDT, including the Younger Dryas event, Indian Ocean precipitation did not mirror the zonal asymmetry observed in Indian Ocean SSTs in the Holocene based upon a speleothem record from Sumatra, but instead reflected shifts in moisture transport pathways and sources. Using Seychelles corals, representing the western pole of the IOD, spanning from the MH to present, Zinke et al. (2014) identified changes in seasonality, with the lowest seasonal SST range in the MH and then again around 2 ka, while the largest seasonal range occurred around 4.6 ka and then again during the near-present (1990–2003). Reconstructions from fossil corals for the eastern Indian Ocean point to stronger negative IOD SST anomalies due to the enhanced upwelling and cooling driven by a stronger monsoon with enhanced anomalous easterly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean during the MH (Abram et al., 2020b). Niedermeyer et al. (2014) from the analysis of stable isotopes in terrestrial plant waxes, suggest that the period 6.5 ka to 4.5 ka was characterized by an anomalously positive IOD mean state. During various parts of the Holocene, periods of a mean positive IOD-like state were associated with increased IOD variability, including events that exceed the\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

During various parts of the Holocene, periods of a mean positive IOD-like state were associated with increased IOD variability, including events that exceed the magnitude of the strongest events during the instrumental period (Abram et al., 2020a).\n\nFrom the coralδ18O record from the Seychelles over 1854–1994, Du et al. (2014) showed a 3–7 year dominant period associated with the IOB in response to ENSO forcing. They identified multi-decadal variability in the IOB, with more active IOB phases during 1870–1890, 1930–1955, and 1975–1992, while decadal variability in the IOB dominated during 1940–1975 (Du et al., 2014). Evidence for changes in IOB characteristics during earlier periods (e.g., MH, LGM) is limited.\n\nThe role of decadal to multi-decadal variability has recently emerged as an important aspect of the IOD with many indications of the effects of Pacific Ocean processes on IOD variability through atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms (Dong et al., 2016; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016; Zhou et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018). Positive events in the 1960s and 1990s were linked to a relatively shallow eastern Indian Ocean thermocline, and a primarily negative IOD state in the 1970s and 1980s was related to a deeper thermocline (Ummenhofer et al., 2016). Positive IOD events may have increased in frequency during the second half of the 20th century (Abram et al., 2020a, b). Earlier observations of apparent changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of the IOD events are considered unreliable, particularly prior to the 1960s (Hernández et al., 2020). Although the seasonal evolution and the type of ENSO (Section 2.4.2) may influence the character of the IOD (Guo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2016), the occurrence of some IOD events may be independent of ENSO (Sun et al\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

In addition to data uncertainties, understanding of the IOB variability during the instrumental period is also limited by large-scale warming of the Indian Ocean. Neither the IOD nor the IOB have exhibited behaviour outside the range implied by proxy records (low confidence).\n\n2.4.4 Atlantic Meridional (AMM) and Zonal Modes (AZM)\nThe AR5 reported no changes in the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) during the 20th century or shorter periods thereof. For the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), also referred as the Atlantic Niño, the AR5 reported increases during the 1950–2012 period but neither assessed trends nor provided a confidence statement. The AR5 did not assess paleo evidence for the AZM and AMM.\n\nPaleo-reconstructions of these two modes remain rather limited. Nonetheless, the interhemispheric cross-equatorial SST gradients linked to changes in ITCZ locations characteristic of the AMM has been found during the LGM, Heinrich Stadial 1, and the MH, with the largest shift occurring during HS1 (McGee et al., 2014). Similarly, the dipole-like SST pattern in the South Atlantic subtropics, which is related to the AZM (Venegas et al., 1996; Morioka et al., 2011; Nnamchi et al., 2016, 2017; Lübbecke et al., 2018; Rouault et al., 2018; Foltz et al., 2019), has been reconstructed using SST proxies from marine sediment cores during the past 12 kyr (Wainer et al., 2014). The reconstructed index captures two significant cold events that occurred during the 12.9–11.6 ka and 8.6–8.0 ka periods in the South Atlantic (Wainer et al., 2014).\n\nDuring the observational period the AZM and AMM (Figure 2.\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

The reconstructed index captures two significant cold events that occurred during the 12.9–11.6 ka and 8.6–8.0 ka periods in the South Atlantic (Wainer et al., 2014).\n\nDuring the observational period the AZM and AMM (Figure 2.37) are related to the AMV largely controlling the interhemispheric gradient of the SST at decadal to multi-decadal timescales (Tokinaga and Xie, 2011; Polo et al., 2013; Svendsen et al., 2014a; Li et al., 2015; Lübbecke et al., 2018). The AZM interannual variability is enhanced (Lübbecke et al., 2018; Foltz et al., 2019), and is more strongly related to ENSO, during the negative phase of the AMV (Martín-Rey et al., 2014, 2018; Polo et al., 2015; Nnamchi et al., 2020). The AZM displayed a persistent weakened variability over the 1960–2009 period associated with declined cold tongue upwelling (Tokinaga and Xie, 2011), which became pronounced since 2000 (Prigent et al., 2020a, b). Despite these multi-decadal fluctuations, there is limited evidence for any sustained change in the AMM (Chang et al., 2011; Martín-Rey et al., 2018) and AZM (Martín-Rey et al., 2018; Nnamchi et al., 2020) during the instrumental period. The AZM and AMM interact on interannual timescales (Servain et al., 1999; Foltz and McPhaden, 2010; Pottapinjara et al., 2019) leading in 2009 to extremes of both modes in which the negative phase of the AMM (Foltz et al., 2012; Burmeister et al., 2016) preceded an equatorial cold tongue cold event that was unprecedented in the prior 30 years (Foltz and McPhaden, 2010; Burmeister et al., 2016).\n\nIn summary, confidence is low in any sustained changes to the AZM and AMM variability in instrumental observations.

There is very low confidence in changes of the paleo AZM and AMM due to extremely limited availability of paleo reconstructions.\n\n2.4.5 Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV)\nPacific Decadal Variability (PDV) refers to the ocean-atmosphere climate variability over the Pacific Ocean at decadal-to-interdecadal time scales and is usually described by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) indices. The AR5 and SROCC reported a large shift of the PDO in the late 1970s, with a predominantly positive phase until the end of the 1990s, being mainly negative afterwards. There was no significant change assessed in the PDO during the instrumental period as a whole, and no confidence level was assigned. Changes in the pre-instrumental era PDO were not assessed in AR5.\n\nThe existence of the PDV in the centuries prior to the instrumental period is evidenced by a variety of proxy records based on tree rings (Biondi et al., 2001; D’Arrigo and Ummenhofer, 2015), corals (Felis et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2013; Linsley et al., 2015) and sediments (Lapointe et al., 2017; O’Mara et al., 2019). There is little coherence between the various paleo-proxy indices prior to the instrumental record, and neither these nor the instrumental records provide indications of a clearly defined spectral peak (Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016; Henley, 2017; L. Zhang et al., 2018; Buckley et al., 2019). For instance, spectral analysis from millennia length PDV reconstructions shows spectral peaks at multi-decadal, centennial and bi-centennial time scales (Beaufort and Grelaud, 2017), while only multi-decadal oscillations can be detected in the shorter (less than 400 years into the past) paleoclimate reconstructions.

A variety of proxies suggest a shift in the PDV from the early-mid Holocene, which was characterized by a persistently negative phase of the PDO (i.e., weak Aleutian Low), to the late Holocene, and more variable and more positive PDO (i.e., strong Aleutian Low) conditions. This shift at around 4.5 ka is also evident in the PDO periodicities, changing from bidecadal and pentadecadal variability in the early Holocene to only pentadecadal periodicities in the late Holocene (Hernández et al., 2020). Several proxy records indicate that the strengthening in the Aleutian Low inferred since the late 17th century is unprecedented over the last millennium (Z. Liu et al., 2017; Osterberg et al., 2017; Winski et al., 2017), in line with an increase in PDV low-frequency variability (Williams et al., 2017; Hernández et al., 2020).\n\nThe PDO and IPO indices are significantly correlated during the instrumental period, showing regime shifts in the 1920s, 1940s, 1970s and around 1999. Positive PDV phases were observed from the 1920s to the mid-1940s and from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, while negative phases occurred from mid-1940s until the late 1970s, and since 1999 (Figure 2.38; Han et al., 2014; Chen and Wallace, 2015; M. Newman et al., 2016). The associated spatial patterns are quite similar, but the PDO pattern exhibits stronger SST anomalies in the extra-tropical North Pacific than the IPO (Chen and Wallace, 2015). The strength and structure of the SST patterns also differ among the periods (M. Newman et al., 2016).\nFigure 2.38 | Indices of multi-decadal climate variability from 1854–2019 based upon several sea surface temperature data products.

Shown are the indices of the AMV and PDV based on area averages for the regions indicated in Annex IV. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1).\n\nInstrumental observations are sparse prior to 1950, and thus the fidelity of any PDV index derived for the second part of the 19th century and early decades of the 20th century is relatively low (Figure 2.38; Deng et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2014). This results inlow agreement in the classification of the PDO/IPO phase among several indices, even during recent years with the availability of high-quality data. Nevertheless, the teleconnection patterns are robust regardless of the index used to characterize the PDO (McAfee, 2017). Analysis of time series of PDO and IPO highlights the (multi-) decadal nature of this mode of variability with no significant trends, but highlights a recent switch from a positive to a negative phase since 1999/2000 across all indicators (England et al., 2014; Henley, 2017).\n\nIn summary, the PDV in the instrumental record is dominated by (multi-)decadal-scale shifts between positive and negative phases over the last 150 years with no overall trend (high confidence). There is low confidence in paleo-PDV reconstructions due to discrepancies among the various available time series in terms of phasing and timing. However, there is high confidence in the occurrence of a shift from predominantly negative to positive PDO conditions from the middle to the late Holocene.\n\n2.4.6 Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability\nThe AR5 reported no robust changes in Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) reconstructions based on paleo records due to low consistency between different AMV reconstructions prior to 1900. AR5 concluded that there have been no significant trends in the AMV index during the instrumental period and there was difficulty in interpreting the AMV signal because of the long-term underlying SST warming trend.\n\nThe AR5 conclusions about large uncertainties in AMV paleo reconstructions (Hernández et al., 2020) have been reinforced by recent studies of tree rings (J. Wang et al., 2017b), Greenland ice (Chylek et al., 2012), and\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Wang et al., 2017b), Greenland ice (Chylek et al., 2012), and corals (Kilbourne et al., 2014; Svendsen et al., 2014b; J. Wang et al., 2017b). The AMV exhibited a generally positive state over the first millennium of the CE (Mann et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2018). Paleo reconstructions over the last millennium consistently show a negative AMV phase during 1400–1850 CE and a positive phase during 900–1200 CE (Mann et al., 2009; J. Wang et al., 2017b; Singh et al., 2018), consistent with warmer surface temperatures from tropical Atlantic records (Kilbourne et al., 2014).\n\nInstrumental observations show that AMV is characterized by basin-wide warm and cool periods with an average variation in SST of about 0.4°C, but with larger variations in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Despite small differences in indices used to define the AMV (Annex IV), they all show warm periods occurring approximately between 1880–1900, 1940–1960, and from the mid-1990s to present, with cool periods in between (Figure 2.38) but no overall sustained change during the instrumental period (Booth et al., 2012; Gulev et al., 2013; Bellomo et al., 2018).\n\nThe oceanic changes are seen in salinity and temperature variations over the upper 3000 m of the North Atlantic (Polyakov et al., 2005; Keenlyside et al., 2015), and in sea level variations in the western North Atlantic along the Gulf Stream passage (McCarthy et al., 2015). The pattern and strength of the AMV differs among the periods (e.g., Svendsen et al., 2014b; Reynolds et al., 2018) and there are indications that there may have been a shift since 2005 toward a negative phase of the AMV (Robson et al., 2016).\n\nIn summary, no sustained change in AMV indices has been observed over the instrumental period (\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

In September 2012, it reached its lowest recorded level since satellite monitoring began in 1978.\n\nThe National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reported that the average Arctic sea ice extent for September was 3.41 million square kilometers below the 1981-2010 average. This is more than twice the size of Texas, which has an area of about 1.7 million square kilometers.\n\nScientists have attributed this decline to a combination of factors including increasing global temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. The Arctic is warming at a rate more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, making it particularly vulnerable to climate change.\n\n######################\nOutput:\n("entity"<|>"Arctic sea ice extent"<|>"geo"<|>"The Arctic sea ice extent refers to the area covered by sea ice in the Arctic region.")\n("entity"<|>"September 2012"<|>"event"<|>"In September 2012, the Arctic sea ice extent reached its lowest recorded level since satellite monitoring began in 1978.")\n("entity"<|>"National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)"<|>"organization"<|>"The National Snow and Ice Data Center is an organization that provides data on snow and ice.")\n("relationship"<|>"Arctic sea ice extent"<|>"September 2012"<|>"In September 2012, the Arctic sea ice extent reached its lowest recorded level."<|>7)\n("relationship"<|>"National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)"<|>"Arctic sea ice extent"<|>"The National Snow and Ice Data Center provides data on Arctic sea ice extent."<|>6)'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Introduction\n\n2\n\nEvolution through natural selection has, over many millions of years, produced structures in r\n\n............................................................... oy\n\nanimals and plants that are superbly adapted to their functions. It is therefore of no surprise that alsociet\n\nscientists have looked at the natural world for inspiration in solving complex human problems, a field known as bioinspiration or biomimetics [1]. Thinking particularly of surfaces, we have, for ypublishing\n\nexample, developed swimsuits with increased drag reduction to enhance swimming efficiency, based on the pattern of dermal denticles (skin scales) that cover the skin of fast-swimming sharks\n\n[2] and Lotusan, a self-cleaning exterior paint, based on the superhydrophobic surface of lotus\n\n.or\n\nleaves [3]. Many more examples are described in a recent review by Sun & Bhushan [4].\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\nThe adhesive mechanisms of climbing animals have clear-cut implications for biomimetics.\n\nFor example, they adhere well to many surfaces, adhesion is reversible so that the adhesive is re-usable, and only stick when required [5,6]. Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7\u20139]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings. These studies have shown ran\n\nthat adhesion is mainly (if not entirely) due to van der Waals forces, as the extremely small tips s.R\n\n(spatulae ca. 200 nm wide and 5\u201320 nm thick) of the highly branched adhesive setae (hairs) on\n\n.So\n\nthe toe pads of geckos are able to achieve extremely close contact with the surface to which the c.A\n\ngecko is adhering. A number of gecko-inspired adhesive structures have been designed and some 377\n\ncan support the weight of a human [12]. However, such gecko-inspired structures are difficult to\n\n:20190131\n\nmimic and their durability is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe adhesion mechanism of tree and torrent frogs is quite different, which means the biomimetic applications arising from it will differ from those developed from geckos. As will be described in this review, tree frogs mainly adhere by wet adhesion, as there is a thin layer of fluid between the toe pad and the adhering substrate. The adhesive forces are thought to be capillarity and viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces [13\u201315], but a role for van der Waals forces cannot be excluded [16]. Tree frog toe pads also generate friction forces; indeed, maximum friction forces may exceed those arising from adhesion [17,18]. As we shall describe, the tree frog\u2019s adhesive mechanism provides good adhesion and friction on soft wet surfaces, and, as a result, is likely to have many important applications, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nA significant body of work has also been carried out on insects. Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues. As we will make clear, studies of the properties of such artificial structures provide insights into the Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nfunctioning of actual toe pads as well as assisting the development of new smart adhesives based on tree frog adhesive and friction mechanisms. Additionally, we will describe some recent applications of the tree frog\u2019s mechanisms of adhesion and friction and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of this exciting field of research.\n\n2. Tree\/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21]. Most of these families are arboreal, living in trees or shrubs (tree frogs such as Hypsiboas boans (figure 1)). However, adhesive pads are also found in frogs living in the region of waterfalls (torrent frogs of the family Ranidae). The adhesive pads are located on\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n3\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet ypublishing\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\nPhil.Trans.R\n\nhypsiboas boans\n\n.Soc.A\n\nFigure 1. Hypsiboas boans is the largest tree frog found in Trinidad (West Indies), with a snout\/vent length of ca 100 mm ( a).\n\n37\n\nLiving high in trees, it is a gliding frog, as can be seen by the presence of webbing between the digits of the fore-limbs. This frog 7:2\n\nhas just landed on a bamboo stem, and has slipped downwards, leaving behind some of the watery fluid that forms its adhesive 0190131\n\njoint ( b) (Allan L, 2013, personal communication).\n\nthe ventral surface of the toes (toe pads), with related structures (sub-articular tubercles) being located on the ventral surface of more proximal digits. The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 \u00b5m diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E \u2248 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force\/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information on deeper structures), are significantly higher, giving a median value of 5.7 MPa. Surface structures will thus have an increased resistance to wear. By contrast, the innermost layers, lying close to sub-dermal lymph spaces and a capillary network, have much lower elastic moduli and thus are extremely soft and pliable. Keratin filaments run inwards from the surface (figure 3) into the pad allowing the pad to maintain its shape in spite of the softness of the pad material [18,24,30,31].\n\n\n\n\n\npolygonal\n\n4\n\ntoe pad\n\nepithelial cells\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n( c)\n\nyalsociet\n\nypublishing\n\n.or\n\n100 mm\n\n5 mm\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n( d )\n\n( e)\n\nPhil.Tran\n\n1 mm\n\n500 nm\n\ns.R.S\n\ntightly packed nanopillars (SEM and TEM)\n\noc.A37\n\nFigure 2.

Reproduced from Drotlef et al. [24].\n\nThe actual epithelial cells ( the outermost layer), have a complex structure. As described below, they are mainly hexagonal in shape and are surrounded by deep, fluid-filled channels (figure 2 c). These channels are thought to serve two functions. First, they help spread the fluid over the entire pad surface, so that there are no air pockets that would reduce adhesion. Second, under wet conditions, they would help to get rid of excess fluid which would reduce adhesion by increasing the separation of pad and surface. The epithelial surface is not flat, but consists of a dense array of nanopillars, 300\u2013500 nm in diameter and 200\u2013300 nm in height (figure 2 d, e) [29]. As figure 4\n\n\n\nCryo-SEM images of nanopillars\n\n5\n\n( a)\n\n( c)\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet ypublishing\n\n.\n\n2\n\nor\n\nmm\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n( b)\n\nPhil.Trans.R.So\n\n300 nm\n\nc\n\n1 mm\n\n.A377:20190131\n\nFigure 4.

( a, b) reproduced from Drotlef et al. [24]; ( c) is reproduced from Scholz et al. [29].\n\nshows, the nanopillars are filled with keratin filaments (figure 4 b) and have a concave upper surface. This opens the question as to whether they could act as miniature suction discs, but this has yet to be investigated. There are thus two sets of structures (the cells separated by grooves and the nanopillars) that allow the pad to keep close contact to rough as well as smooth surfaces, promoting both adhesion and friction forces.\n\nThe watery pad fluid has a viscosity of 1.25\u20131.51 mPa s\u22121. Using a laser tweezer technique, Federle et al. [23] have shown that the fluid secreted by the toe pads has a low viscosity in the range 1.25\u20131.51 mPa s\u22121 (figure 5). It is usually referred to as mucus, but detailed chemistry remains to be identified. It is secreted by glands within the toes and passes to the pad surface through narrow ducts which open into the grooves that separate the pad epithelial cells. It completely fills the space below the pad and forms a meniscus around the edge of the pad, producing capillary forces [14, 32]. The fluid is, however, known to contain molecules that act as surfactants Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n[33], lowering surface tension and thus allowing capillary adhesion to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. surfaces of waxy leaves).\n\nThe fluid layer below each epithelial cell has a thickness of the order of a few nanometres. Federle et al.\n\n[23], using interference reflection microscopy, have shown that the fluid under the toe pads has a low thickness, except around the edges of the epithelial cells, where the channels between the epithelial cells are located (figure 6). This means that, in addition to capillary forces, substantial velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces will be present [34]. Indeed, torrent frogs can adhere in running water when the pads are completely submerged, a situation where capillary forces would be absent [35,36].\n\nTree frog toe pads produce higher friction than adhesive forces, a surprising finding for a fluid joint.\n\nFederle et al. [23] have shown that it is due to the nanopillars, which form extremely close contact with the external surface (in the range 0\u20135 nm (figure 6 d)). Nanopillars cover the surface of all the pad epithelial cells (figures 2 and 4), but are absent from other, non-adhesive areas of the skin\n\n\n\n\n\n( a) 1.0\n\n6\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n0.5\n\nyalsociet\n\nmm)\n\nypublishing\n\n0\n\nposition ( \u20130.5\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\n\u20131.0 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\ntime (s)\n\n( b) 1.0\n\nPhi\n\nfrog mucus\n\nl.Tra\n\nwater\n\nn\n\n0.8\n\ns.R.Soc\n\nmm) 0.6\n\n.A377:2\n\n0.4\n\n0190131\n\namplitude (\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nfrequency (Hz)\n\nFigure 5.

However, it is important to note that the presence of these areas of very close contact means that molecular mechanisms of adhesion cannot be excluded [16].\n\nLymph spaces whose profiles are easily deformed by the slightest application of pressure. These spaces lie in the dermis below the toe pads and contribute to their remarkable softness and high deformability. Under pressure, they increase the contact area and improve conformation to the Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nunderlying surface topography [31], thus promoting both adhesion and friction.\n\nPad detachment occurs by peeling from the proximal edge of the pads during both forward walking and climbing [37], a mechanism requiring rather small forces (less than 10 mN).\n\nSelf-cleaning. Force measurements on both unrestrained free-walking frogs and individual toe pads [8] show that, following contamination by glass beads, toe pad adhesive forces recover after a few steps. Both shear movements and a flushing effect of the secreted mucus play important roles in shedding contaminating particles.\n\nAdhesion to rough surfaces. In their natural habitat, tree frogs need to be able to adhere to surfaces of various roughnesses, including leaves, rocks and bark. Tests in a laboratory setting demonstrate that both adhesion and friction are maintained [38] or increased [39] on micro-rough surfaces (asperity size 0.1\u201330 \u00b5m) and only show a significant decline when asperity size reaches 50 \u00b5m.\n\nCrawford et al. provide evidence that, on these roughest surfaces, the pads secrete insufficient fluid to fill the space under the pad, leaving air pockets that would significantly reduce the\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n7\n\n( b) 1.0\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oy\n\nmm)\n\nalsociet\n\n0.5\n\nypublishing\n\n(epidermal cell)\n\nilm thickness (\n\n(mucus)\n\n.\n\nfluid f\n\n0\n\nor\n\n(substrate)\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nposition (mm)\n\n( c)\n\n( d ) 45\n\n40\n\n35\n\nPhi\n\n30\n\nl\n\ny\n\n.Tr\n\n25\n\nans\n\n20\n\n.R\n\nfrequenc\n\n.\n\n15\n\nSoc\n\n10\n\n.A\n\n5\n\n377\n\n0\n\n:2\n\n0\u20135\n\n5\u201310 10\u201315 15\u201320 20\u201325 25\u201330 30\u201335\n\n0190131\n\nfluid film thickness (nm)\n\nFigure 6. Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) used to measure the thickness of the fluid layer under a toe pad of a living, adhering tree frog ( Litoria caerulea). What one sees is the interference pattern resulting from the interference of light reflected from the surface of the pad with light reflected from the top surface of the glass to which the frog is adhering. By comparing images of the same pad with green and blue monochromatic light, one can identify which fringe is which, and thus estimate the thickness of the fluid layer under each pad epithelial cell. ( a) A representative IRM image and ( b) the calculated thickness of the fluid layer along the white arrow in ( a). Note that this arrow goes through the middle of an epithelial cell, and that the thickness of the fluid layer at these points is very small. ( c) Opening the aperture of the microscope reduces the depth of focus so that only zero-order fringes are seen, allowing a more accurate measurement of pad\/ground distances under the pad epithelial cells.

However, the conflicting results on the lower roughnesses leave unanswered the question of whether the low elastic modulus of the toe pads allows them to mould themselves to the contours of all but the largest asperities. However, as Crawford et al., using interference reflection microscopy, were able to observe that small glass Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nbeads (less than 5 \u00b5m diameter) could become lodged in the channels between the cells, it is clear that the nature of the epithelium (cells surrounded by channels) allows interdigitation of asperities on the external surface and the toe pad epithelium.\n\nSimilarity of toe pad structure in different families of tree frogs. There are extraordinary similarities between the structure of toe pads in different frog families (hylid and rhacophorid frogs have been compared in detail by Barnes et al. [30]). They have important implications for biomimetics, for such convergent evolution suggests a good starting point for attempts to develop adhesives that will function in wet conditions.\n\n(b) Mechanisms of adhesion and friction and the forces they produce: physical principles Although the dominant force in tree frog adhesion is thought to be capillarity, viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces are also considered to play a role.

A common model that has been used for quantifying capillary forces consists of a sphere on a plane surface, connected by a drop of liquid (figure 7). In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = \u22122 \u03c0R\u03b3 (cos \u03b8 1 + cos \u03b8 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid, and \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = \u22124 \u03c0R\u03b3 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8).

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2. It is negligible for high Young\u2019s moduli, but becomes significant for soft materials.\n\n\u03c0\u03b3 3\n\nFL = \u22124 \u03c0r\u03b3 \u2212\n\n\u00b7 2 r 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 r\n\n3( E eff)2\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus.\n\n10\n\nWet adhesion\u2014viscous forces.

During tests on a \u2018model toe pad\u2019, the pad generated forces 7\n\nthat resisted slip for periods in excess of 200 s. This is fine for a moving frog, but could present\n\n:20190131\n\nproblems for a frog at rest. Also, as the fluid used in the model toe pad (silicone oil) had a viscosity several orders of magnitude greater than tree frog mucus, it remains unclear whether the mechanism is applicable to frogs.\n\nToe pad adhesion and friction forces. Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems\/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14]. Frogs are weighed and then placed \u2018head-up\u2019 on a smooth surface on a rotation platform that is rotated slowly from 0\u00b0\n\n(horizontal), through 90\u00b0 (vertical) to 180\u00b0 (upside-down). The angles at which the frog falls from the surface (fall angle) are recorded. These fall angles are used to calculate maximum adhesive forces by simple trigonometry [32]. If the total toe pad area is also measured, these values can be converted to the force per unit area that toe pads can generate. Figure 10 a shows the masses of Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n14 different frog species (12 of which were hylids). Measured total toe pad areas of these same frogs appear in figure 10 b, while angles of fall from the rotation platform for these 14 frog species (means of 10 measurements for each frog) are plotted in figure 11 c. Since frogs have an area-based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]\n\ndemonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n11\n\n)2\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oya\n\n10\n\n100\n\nlsociet\n\nypublishing\n\nmass (g)\n\n1\n\n10\n\ntoe-pad area (mm\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n.or\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nSVL (mm)\n\n( c)\n\n( d )\n\n)\n\n180\n\n10\n\n\u20132\n\n135\n\nPhil.Tra\n\n90\n\n1\n\nns.R\n\nfall angle (\u00ba)\n\n.S\n\n45\n\noc.A37\n\n0\n\nforce\/unit area (mN mm 0.1\n\n7\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n:20190131\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nFigure 10.

Both friction and adhesion components of the resultant force are shown for a 70\u00b0 pull-off, which followed a short initial slide, designed to ensure good initial contact of pad and force plate. A drop of water was then gently added, covering the pad in such a way that the meniscus around the edge of the pad was abolished. As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad\u2013ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n\u2018remaining\u2019 friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 \u00b1 1.14 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 \u00b1 5.11 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al. [16], that toe pads are optimally developed for friction rather than 13\n\nadhesion.\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 3. Biomimetics of tree frog adhesion and friction\n\nypublishing\n\nLearning from biology to develop new materials and devices, aiming to solve problems in daily life, medical, industry, etc., comes along with human history, though the word \u2018biomimetics\u2019 is a relatively new word, coined by Otto Schmitt in 1957. The mimicking of the clinging abilities of geckos and tree-frogs are always attractive for people, so that animal-inspired adhesives have\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\naroused more and more attention in recent years. However, gecko-inspired materials\/devices have caught most of the attention because the origin of gecko adhesion is considered mainly to be due to van der Waals forces so that gecko-mimicking can simply focus on the design and construction of pillar-like structures with various materials and dimensions. Though simple hexagonal structures are present on the toe pads of tree frogs, they are covered by an array of Ph\n\nnanopillars and the mechanism of its adhesion is much more complicated, as described above.\n\nil.T\n\nThough the toe pads of tree frogs look quite different from the hairy gecko pads (figure 2 a), rans\n\nthey both can be considered as pillar arrays [45]. A variety of manufacturing technologies [4]\n\n.R.\n\nhave been developed to construct pillar arrays in materials with Young\u2019s moduli ranging from Soc\n\n1TPa to several MPa (for instance, 1TPa of carbon nanotube (CNT) [46], several GPa of polymers\n\n.A37\n\nlike polyurethane (PU) [47], polystyrene [48], polystyrene-block-poly(vinyl-2-pyridine) (PS-b-7:\n\nP2VP) [49] and 1\u20133 MPa of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [50]). Because of the huge difference in 20190131\n\nYoung\u2019s modulus, pillar arrays with different materials can produce different aspect ratios (AR), which is vital for the stability and adhesion performance of pillar arrays.\n\n(a) Influences of aspect ratio of pillar\n\nThough CNT possesses a large Young\u2019s modulus of 1TPa, the CNT forest shows a much smaller effective modulus ( E eff), which allows CNT forests to maximize contacts, increasing the adhesion force [51]. CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm\u22122, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H\/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads, the pillar tops are never smooth. As described above, concave nanostructures have been found on the toe pads of tree frogs (figure 4), and peg-structures have also been reported in bush-crickets [56]. Li et al.

The increased friction force of this hierarchical hexagonal structure, especially in the hydrophilic state, demonstrated the importance of nanostructures on toe pads of tree frogs (figure 14 b). Moreover, concave, spatular, T-shape and spherical micropillar tops were also constructed to investigate the adhesion properties. T-shape pillars, prepared by conventional moulding [59] and inking\u2013printing\u2013curing (IPC) methods, exhibited maximum adhesion strength, both in wet [60] and dry [48, 61] conditions. Both the higher compliance and comparatively large contact area contribute to the outstanding performance. Furthermore, the crack initiation tends to start from the centre during the detachment [62], which results in a suction effect, contributing positively to the adhesion [59].\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n(b) Influences of micro- and nanostructure\n\nInspired by the existence of nanopillars in toe pad of tree frogs, we fabricated a composite structure with aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars embedded in soft PDMS hexagonal micropillars [63]. Both adhesion and friction forces were greatly enhanced compared to the structure with pure PDMS. The finite-element simulation suggests that the embedded nanopillars could regulate the stress distribution across the contact interface, with the stress maximum being distributed on top of a row of nanopillars close to the micropillar perimeter (but not at the centre of contact area or at the very edge of the pillar; figure 14 d). This is similar to the T-shape pillars inspired by gecko setae, which can also shift the stress maximum to the centre of the contact area, inhibiting the crack initiation during pulling. However, the composite structure should possess a much higher stability and durability since the nanopillars are embedded.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n( b)\n\n( a)\n\nhydrophobic\n\n15\n\nhydrophilic\n\nload: in; flood\n\nr\n\n1.0\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 0.5\n\nypublishing\n\nfriction force (N)\n\n0\n\nflat hexagon 10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\narea density of pillars ( l)\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\nS \/ S\n\n33\n\n33-avg\n\n( c)\n\n( d )\n\n1.99\n\n1.85\n\n1.71\n\n1.58\n\n1.44\n\n1.30\n\n1.16\n\n1.03\n\n0.89\n\n0.75\n\n0.61\n\nP\n\n0.47\n\nh\n\n0.34\n\nil.Trans.R.Soc.A\n\n( e)\n\n( f )\n\ncore\n\nshell\n\n\/ R = 5\/6\n\n37\n\nt\/ R = 0.1 Ri\n\n7\n\nE , v\n\nc\n\nc\n\nE , v\n\n:\n\ns\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0190131\n\n0.7\n\nz\n\nH\n\nR\n\n\/ s avg-\n\ni\n\ns z 1\n\ncontrol\n\nt\n\nR\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 14.

It was found that a thinner layer of PDMS on the pillar end is Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nmore efficient in reducing the stress at the pillar edge, contributing to the adhesion enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, by coating a thin layer of PDMS onto the gecko-inspired T-shaped micropillar made of polyurethane acrylate (PUA) could sharply enhance the shear adhesion as compared the same structure but composed of either PDMS or PUA [65]. If the core is composed of a polymer material whose stiffness significant decreases by applying an electric current, dynamic tuning of adhesion was successfully realized by the modulation of subsurface stiffness [66].\n\n(c) Adhesion with liquid at interface\n\nThere is mucus on the toe pads of tree frogs, so that a thin layer of liquid is always present at the contact interface. Therefore, tree frog adhesion is considered as wet adhesion, compared to the dry adhesion of geckos. To mimic wet adhesion, spreading a layer of liquid on the structured surface is widely employed [60, 67,68].

It was found that, in the main, short-range attractive forces dominate\n\n.So\n\nadhesion when the PDMS surface is hydrophobic, as the glycerol may be squeezed out from c.A37\n\nthe contact area forming direct contacts. It therefore behaves like gecko-inspired structured 7\n\nadhesive, showing a strong dependence on the contact geometry [60]. By contrast, long-range\n\n:20190131\n\nattractive forces associated with capillarity dominate when the surface is hydrophilic. In this situation, capillary force dominates the adhesion strength, independent of the microstructures on the surface. It was suggested that the adhesion enhancement in the presence of fluid could be the result of crack arresting by liquid, in addition to the capillary forces [69]. It should be noted that excessive liquid will produce a lubrication region, leading to a reduction in adhesion and friction [69,70]. Since the surface wettability has a strong influence on wet adhesion, the switching of a surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic, e.g. by temperature, could therefore regulate the wet adhesion. By coating a layer of temperature responsive copolymer poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl acrylate-co-isopropyl acrylamide) (p(DMA-co-MEA-coNIPAAm) on PDMS micropillars, switching of underwater adhesion was successfully achieved by simply adjusting the temperature of the water bath (figure 15 b) [71].\n\nThe microstructure of the toe pads of animals like tree frogs is considered to play a very important role in wet adhesion. It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid\u2013solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72,73]. Due to the polygonal nature of frog-inspired micropatterns, shear adhesion (friction) shows orientation dependence. In our previous work, wet friction was found to be the highest along the direction of side-sliding (figure 16 a) [55]. Moreover, elongated hexagonal micropillars show an even higher friction at the same orientation. The effective arresting of cracks increases following the edge density per unit length along the friction direction, contributing to friction Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nenhancement. The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].

This means that capillary force may serve as the major contributor to wet adhesion on a rough surface [77]. Moreover, structured adhesives could effectively slow down the evaporation of liquid on the rough substrates, which is quite important for tree frogs and other animals using wet adhesion in their natural environment [38].\n\nWhile most studies of wet adhesion on artificial materials involved coating a thin layer of liquid on the structured surface, a few reported the delivery of liquid to the contact area mimicking the secretion of animals [49, 80]. Making use of the microphase separation of block copolymer poly(styrene- b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS2VP), nanopillars with 98 nm internal channels were designed to deliver liquid to the contact area, mimicking the dynamic secretion of animals.\n\nThe combination of material softening in high humidity and the transportation of mineral oil to the contact interface greatly increased the adhesion force by two orders of magnitude. The comparison of work of adhesion at different humidities suggests that the contribution of liquid Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nbridges remained the same, while direct solid\u2013solid contact was 30 times higher when the relative humidity increased from 25 to 90% (figure 17 c). Interestingly, Vogel et al. [80] have designed a device with a plate full of holes. Water can be pumped into the holes via channels beneath the plate and form droplet arrays on the plate (figure 17 a). Each droplet can therefore form a liquid bridge with a contacting surface, creating an adhesion force at the interface. Indeed, with all the liquid droplets acting together, the device can generate a substantial adhesion force.\n\n4. Applications\n\nAlthough the mimicking of tree frog-inspired wet adhesion is still in its infancy, there are already some attempts to make use of it in the area of bionic robots [81], soft tissue engineering [82], etc.\n\nFor instance, Tsipenyuk prepared a variety of polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) hexagonal patterns as the stretching unit for disposable safety razors [82].

Thus, the friction force was double that of commercial products and stretched the moist skin much better. Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74]. More recently, a biomimetic skin patch inspired by the hexagonal pattern of tree frog toe pads and the convex cup of octopus suckers has been reported\n\n(figure 18 c) [83]. The patch exhibited outstanding adhesion performance on human skin, even in\n\n\n\n\n\na water flowing environment.

Conclusion and outlook\n\nypublishing\n\nIt is clear that tree frogs exhibit outstanding wet adhesion properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years, both in our understanding of how tree frogs adhere and in the development of tree frog-inspired wet adhesives. But many questions remain unanswered. For instance, while\n\n.or\n\nmost of the tree frog-mimicking studies have focused on the micropattern on the toe pad, more g\/journal\/rsta\n\nattention should be given to forming a better understanding of the role of the nanostructures.\n\nCould there be synergistic interactions between the micro- and nanostructures and the mucus?\n\nMoreover, since the animals keep secreting all the time, the liquid volume at the contacting interface should change accordingly. How will this dynamic process contribute to adhesion and P\n\nfriction during the locomotion of animals? And can we make use of the dynamic process? The hil.T\n\nanswers to these questions could deepen our understanding of the adhesion of tree frogs and ran\n\nspeed the development of applications of bioinspired wet adhesion.\n\ns.R.\n\nData accessibility.

Introduction\n\n2\n\nEvolution through natural selection has, over many millions of years, produced structures in r\n\n............................................................... oy\n\nanimals and plants that are superbly adapted to their functions. It is therefore of no surprise that alsociet\n\nscientists have looked at the natural world for inspiration in solving complex human problems, a field known as bioinspiration or biomimetics [1]. Thinking particularly of surfaces, we have, for ypublishing\n\nexample, developed swimsuits with increased drag reduction to enhance swimming efficiency, based on the pattern of dermal denticles (skin scales) that cover the skin of fast-swimming sharks\n\n[2] and Lotusan, a self-cleaning exterior paint, based on the superhydrophobic surface of lotus\n\n.or\n\nleaves [3]. Many more examples are described in a recent review by Sun & Bhushan [4].\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\nThe adhesive mechanisms of climbing animals have clear-cut implications for biomimetics.\n\nFor example, they adhere well to many surfaces, adhesion is reversible so that the adhesive is re-usable, and only stick when required [5,6]. Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7\u20139]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings. These studies have shown ran\n\nthat adhesion is mainly (if not entirely) due to van der Waals forces, as the extremely small tips s.R\n\n(spatulae ca. 200 nm wide and 5\u201320 nm thick) of the highly branched adhesive setae (hairs) on\n\n.So\n\nthe toe pads of geckos are able to achieve extremely close contact with the surface to which the c.A\n\ngecko is adhering. A number of gecko-inspired adhesive structures have been designed and some 377\n\ncan support the weight of a human [12]. However, such gecko-inspired structures are difficult to\n\n:20190131\n\nmimic and their durability is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe adhesion mechanism of tree and torrent frogs is quite different, which means the biomimetic applications arising from it will differ from those developed from geckos. As will be described in this review, tree frogs mainly adhere by wet adhesion, as there is a thin layer of fluid between the toe pad and the adhering substrate. The adhesive forces are thought to be capillarity and viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces [13\u201315], but a role for van der Waals forces cannot be excluded [16]. Tree frog toe pads also generate friction forces; indeed, maximum friction forces may exceed those arising from adhesion [17,18]. As we shall describe, the tree frog\u2019s adhesive mechanism provides good adhesion and friction on soft wet surfaces, and, as a result, is likely to have many important applications, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nA significant body of work has also been carried out on insects. Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues. As we will make clear, studies of the properties of such artificial structures provide insights into the Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nfunctioning of actual toe pads as well as assisting the development of new smart adhesives based on tree frog adhesive and friction mechanisms. Additionally, we will describe some recent applications of the tree frog\u2019s mechanisms of adhesion and friction and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of this exciting field of research.\n\n2. Tree\/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21]. Most of these families are arboreal, living in trees or shrubs (tree frogs such as Hypsiboas boans (figure 1)). However, adhesive pads are also found in frogs living in the region of waterfalls (torrent frogs of the family Ranidae). The adhesive pads are located on\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n3\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet ypublishing\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\nPhil.Trans.R\n\nhypsiboas boans\n\n.Soc.A\n\nFigure 1. Hypsiboas boans is the largest tree frog found in Trinidad (West Indies), with a snout\/vent length of ca 100 mm ( a).\n\n37\n\nLiving high in trees, it is a gliding frog, as can be seen by the presence of webbing between the digits of the fore-limbs. This frog 7:2\n\nhas just landed on a bamboo stem, and has slipped downwards, leaving behind some of the watery fluid that forms its adhesive 0190131\n\njoint ( b) (Allan L, 2013, personal communication).\n\nthe ventral surface of the toes (toe pads), with related structures (sub-articular tubercles) being located on the ventral surface of more proximal digits. The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 \u00b5m diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E \u2248 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force\/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information on deeper structures), are significantly higher, giving a median value of 5.7 MPa. Surface structures will thus have an increased resistance to wear. By contrast, the innermost layers, lying close to sub-dermal lymph spaces and a capillary network, have much lower elastic moduli and thus are extremely soft and pliable. Keratin filaments run inwards from the surface (figure 3) into the pad allowing the pad to maintain its shape in spite of the softness of the pad material [18,24,30,31].\n\n\n\n\n\npolygonal\n\n4\n\ntoe pad\n\nepithelial cells\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n( c)\n\nyalsociet\n\nypublishing\n\n.or\n\n100 mm\n\n5 mm\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n( d )\n\n( e)\n\nPhil.Tran\n\n1 mm\n\n500 nm\n\ns.R.S\n\ntightly packed nanopillars (SEM and TEM)\n\noc.A37\n\nFigure 2.

Reproduced from Drotlef et al. [24].\n\nThe actual epithelial cells ( the outermost layer), have a complex structure. As described below, they are mainly hexagonal in shape and are surrounded by deep, fluid-filled channels (figure 2 c). These channels are thought to serve two functions. First, they help spread the fluid over the entire pad surface, so that there are no air pockets that would reduce adhesion. Second, under wet conditions, they would help to get rid of excess fluid which would reduce adhesion by increasing the separation of pad and surface. The epithelial surface is not flat, but consists of a dense array of nanopillars, 300\u2013500 nm in diameter and 200\u2013300 nm in height (figure 2 d, e) [29].

This opens the question as to whether they could act as miniature suction discs, but this has yet to be investigated. There are thus two sets of structures (the cells separated by grooves and the nanopillars) that allow the pad to keep close contact to rough as well as smooth surfaces, promoting both adhesion and friction forces.\n\nThe watery pad fluid has a viscosity of 1.25\u20131.51 mPa s\u22121. Using a laser tweezer technique, Federle et al. [23] have shown that the fluid secreted by the toe pads has a low viscosity in the range 1.25\u20131.51 mPa s\u22121 (figure 5). It is usually referred to as mucus, but detailed chemistry remains to be identified. It is secreted by glands within the toes and passes to the pad surface through narrow ducts which open into the grooves that separate the pad epithelial cells. It completely fills the space below the pad and forms a meniscus around the edge of the pad, producing capillary forces [14, 32]. The fluid is, however, known to contain molecules that act as surfactants Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n[33], lowering surface tension and thus allowing capillary adhesion to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. surfaces of waxy leaves).\n\nThe fluid layer below each epithelial cell has a thickness of the order of a few nanometres. Federle et al.\n\n[23], using interference reflection microscopy, have shown that the fluid under the toe pads has a low thickness, except around the edges of the epithelial cells, where the channels between the epithelial cells are located (figure 6). This means that, in addition to capillary forces, substantial velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces will be present [34]. Indeed, torrent frogs can adhere in running water when the pads are completely submerged, a situation where capillary forces would be absent [35,36].\n\nTree frog toe pads produce higher friction than adhesive forces, a surprising finding for a fluid joint.\n\nFederle et al. [23] have shown that it is due to the nanopillars, which form extremely close contact with the external surface (in the range 0\u20135 nm (figure 6 d)). Nanopillars cover the surface of all the pad epithelial cells (figures 2 and 4), but are absent from other, non-adhesive areas of the skin\n\n\n\n\n\n( a) 1.0\n\n6\n\nr\n\n............................................................... o\n\n0.5\n\nyalsociet\n\nmm)\n\nypublishing\n\n0\n\nposition ( \u20130.5\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\n\u20131.0 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\ntime (s)\n\n( b) 1.0\n\nPhi\n\nfrog mucus\n\nl.Tra\n\nwater\n\nn\n\n0.8\n\ns.R.Soc\n\nmm) 0.6\n\n.A377:2\n\n0.4\n\n0190131\n\namplitude (\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nfrequency (Hz)\n\nFigure 5.

However, it is important to note that the presence of these areas of very close contact means that molecular mechanisms of adhesion cannot be excluded [16].\n\nLymph spaces whose profiles are easily deformed by the slightest application of pressure. These spaces lie in the dermis below the toe pads and contribute to their remarkable softness and high deformability. Under pressure, they increase the contact area and improve conformation to the Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nunderlying surface topography [31], thus promoting both adhesion and friction.\n\nPad detachment occurs by peeling from the proximal edge of the pads during both forward walking and climbing [37], a mechanism requiring rather small forces (less than 10 mN).\n\nSelf-cleaning. Force measurements on both unrestrained free-walking frogs and individual toe pads [8] show that, following contamination by glass beads, toe pad adhesive forces recover after a few steps. Both shear movements and a flushing effect of the secreted mucus play important roles in shedding contaminating particles.\n\nAdhesion to rough surfaces. In their natural habitat, tree frogs need to be able to adhere to surfaces of various roughnesses, including leaves, rocks and bark. Tests in a laboratory setting demonstrate that both adhesion and friction are maintained [38] or increased [39] on micro-rough surfaces (asperity size 0.1\u201330 \u00b5m) and only show a significant decline when asperity size reaches 50 \u00b5m.\n\nCrawford et al. provide evidence that, on these roughest surfaces, the pads secrete insufficient fluid to fill the space under the pad, leaving air pockets that would significantly reduce the\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n7\n\n( b) 1.0\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oy\n\nmm)\n\nalsociet\n\n0.5\n\nypublishing\n\n(epidermal cell)\n\nilm thickness (\n\n(mucus)\n\n.\n\nfluid f\n\n0\n\nor\n\n(substrate)\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nposition (mm)\n\n( c)\n\n( d ) 45\n\n40\n\n35\n\nPhi\n\n30\n\nl\n\ny\n\n.Tr\n\n25\n\nans\n\n20\n\n.R\n\nfrequenc\n\n.\n\n15\n\nSoc\n\n10\n\n.A\n\n5\n\n377\n\n0\n\n:2\n\n0\u20135\n\n5\u201310 10\u201315 15\u201320 20\u201325 25\u201330 30\u201335\n\n0190131\n\nfluid film thickness (nm)\n\nFigure 6. Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) used to measure the thickness of the fluid layer under a toe pad of a living, adhering tree frog ( Litoria caerulea). What one sees is the interference pattern resulting from the interference of light reflected from the surface of the pad with light reflected from the top surface of the glass to which the frog is adhering. By comparing images of the same pad with green and blue monochromatic light, one can identify which fringe is which, and thus estimate the thickness of the fluid layer under each pad epithelial cell.

There are extraordinary similarities between the structure of toe pads in different frog families (hylid and rhacophorid frogs have been compared in detail by Barnes et al. [30]). They have important implications for biomimetics, for such convergent evolution suggests a good starting point for attempts to develop adhesives that will function in wet conditions.\n\n(b) Mechanisms of adhesion and friction and the forces they produce: physical principles Although the dominant force in tree frog adhesion is thought to be capillarity, viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces are also considered to play a role.

The physical 7:2\n\nprinciples underlying capillarity and hydrodynamic forces are outlined below.\n\n0190131\n\nWet adhesion\u2014capillary forces. A common model that has been used for quantifying capillary forces consists of a sphere on a plane surface, connected by a drop of liquid (figure 7). In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = \u22122 \u03c0R\u03b3 (cos \u03b8 1 + cos \u03b8 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid, and \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. \u03b8 1 and \u03b8 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = \u22124 \u03c0R\u03b3 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8). This model produces substantial forces if the radius ( r) of the area of contact is large and the separation distance of the plates ( h) is small, according to the following Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nequation:\n\nFL = \u03c0r 2 \u03b3 [ r\u22121 \u2212 (cos \u03b8 1 + cos \u03b8 2) h\u22121].\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn a large flat meniscus where r h and \u03b8 1 = \u03b8 2 = 0, equation (2.3) approximates to equation (2.4), namely\n\nFL \u2248 \u2212 2 \u03c0r 2 \u03b3 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nh\n\nA second component of the adhesive force is the tensile force of the meniscus (figure 9).

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2. It is negligible for high Young\u2019s moduli, but becomes significant for soft materials.\n\n\u03c0\u03b3 3\n\nFL = \u22124 \u03c0r\u03b3 \u2212\n\n\u00b7 2 r 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 r\n\n3( E eff)2\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus.\n\n10\n\nWet adhesion\u2014viscous forces.

During tests on a \u2018model toe pad\u2019, the pad generated forces 7\n\nthat resisted slip for periods in excess of 200 s. This is fine for a moving frog, but could present\n\n:20190131\n\nproblems for a frog at rest. Also, as the fluid used in the model toe pad (silicone oil) had a viscosity several orders of magnitude greater than tree frog mucus, it remains unclear whether the mechanism is applicable to frogs.\n\nToe pad adhesion and friction forces. Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems\/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14]. Frogs are weighed and then placed \u2018head-up\u2019 on a smooth surface on a rotation platform that is rotated slowly from 0\u00b0\n\n(horizontal), through 90\u00b0 (vertical) to 180\u00b0 (upside-down). The angles at which the frog falls from the surface (fall angle) are recorded. These fall angles are used to calculate maximum adhesive forces by simple trigonometry [32]. If the total toe pad area is also measured, these values can be converted to the force per unit area that toe pads can generate. Figure 10 a shows the masses of Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n14 different frog species (12 of which were hylids). Measured total toe pad areas of these same frogs appear in figure 10 b, while angles of fall from the rotation platform for these 14 frog species (means of 10 measurements for each frog) are plotted in figure 11 c. Since frogs have an area-based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]\n\ndemonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n11\n\n)2\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oya\n\n10\n\n100\n\nlsociet\n\nypublishing\n\nmass (g)\n\n1\n\n10\n\ntoe-pad area (mm\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n.or\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\ng\/journal\/rsta\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nSVL (mm)\n\n( c)\n\n( d )\n\n)\n\n180\n\n10\n\n\u20132\n\n135\n\nPhil.Tra\n\n90\n\n1\n\nns.R\n\nfall angle (\u00ba)\n\n.S\n\n45\n\noc.A37\n\n0\n\nforce\/unit area (mN mm 0.1\n\n7\n\n10\n\n100\n\n10\n\n100\n\n:20190131\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nSVL (mm)\n\nFigure 10.

Both friction and adhesion components of the resultant force are shown for a 70\u00b0 pull-off, which followed a short initial slide, designed to ensure good initial contact of pad and force plate. A drop of water was then gently added, covering the pad in such a way that the meniscus around the edge of the pad was abolished. As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad\u2013ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n\u2018remaining\u2019 friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 \u00b1 1.14 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 \u00b1 5.11 mN mm\u22122 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al. [16], that toe pads are optimally developed for friction rather than 13\n\nadhesion.\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 3. Biomimetics of tree frog adhesion and friction\n\nypublishing\n\nLearning from biology to develop new materials and devices, aiming to solve problems in daily life, medical, industry, etc., comes along with human history, though the word \u2018biomimetics\u2019 is a relatively new word, coined by Otto Schmitt in 1957. The mimicking of the clinging abilities of geckos and tree-frogs are always attractive for people, so that animal-inspired adhesives have\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\naroused more and more attention in recent years. However, gecko-inspired materials\/devices have caught most of the attention because the origin of gecko adhesion is considered mainly to be due to van der Waals forces so that gecko-mimicking can simply focus on the design and construction of pillar-like structures with various materials and dimensions. Though simple hexagonal structures are present on the toe pads of tree frogs, they are covered by an array of Ph\n\nnanopillars and the mechanism of its adhesion is much more complicated, as described above.\n\nil.T\n\nThough the toe pads of tree frogs look quite different from the hairy gecko pads (figure 2 a), rans\n\nthey both can be considered as pillar arrays [45]. A variety of manufacturing technologies [4]\n\n.R.\n\nhave been developed to construct pillar arrays in materials with Young\u2019s moduli ranging from Soc\n\n1TPa to several MPa (for instance, 1TPa of carbon nanotube (CNT) [46], several GPa of polymers\n\n.A37\n\nlike polyurethane (PU) [47], polystyrene [48], polystyrene-block-poly(vinyl-2-pyridine) (PS-b-7:\n\nP2VP) [49] and 1\u20133 MPa of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [50]). Because of the huge difference in 20190131\n\nYoung\u2019s modulus, pillar arrays with different materials can produce different aspect ratios (AR), which is vital for the stability and adhesion performance of pillar arrays.\n\n(a) Influences of aspect ratio of pillar\n\nThough CNT possesses a large Young\u2019s modulus of 1TPa, the CNT forest shows a much smaller effective modulus ( E eff), which allows CNT forests to maximize contacts, increasing the adhesion force [51]. CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm\u22122, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H\/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads, the pillar tops are never smooth. As described above, concave nanostructures have been found on the toe pads of tree frogs (figure 4), and peg-structures have also been reported in bush-crickets [56]. Li et al.

The increased friction force of this hierarchical hexagonal structure, especially in the hydrophilic state, demonstrated the importance of nanostructures on toe pads of tree frogs (figure 14 b). Moreover, concave, spatular, T-shape and spherical micropillar tops were also constructed to investigate the adhesion properties. T-shape pillars, prepared by conventional moulding [59] and inking\u2013printing\u2013curing (IPC) methods, exhibited maximum adhesion strength, both in wet [60] and dry [48, 61] conditions. Both the higher compliance and comparatively large contact area contribute to the outstanding performance. Furthermore, the crack initiation tends to start from the centre during the detachment [62], which results in a suction effect, contributing positively to the adhesion [59].\n\nDownloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\n(b) Influences of micro- and nanostructure\n\nInspired by the existence of nanopillars in toe pad of tree frogs, we fabricated a composite structure with aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars embedded in soft PDMS hexagonal micropillars [63]. Both adhesion and friction forces were greatly enhanced compared to the structure with pure PDMS. The finite-element simulation suggests that the embedded nanopillars could regulate the stress distribution across the contact interface, with the stress maximum being distributed on top of a row of nanopillars close to the micropillar perimeter (but not at the centre of contact area or at the very edge of the pillar; figure 14 d). This is similar to the T-shape pillars inspired by gecko setae, which can also shift the stress maximum to the centre of the contact area, inhibiting the crack initiation during pulling. However, the composite structure should possess a much higher stability and durability since the nanopillars are embedded.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n( b)\n\n( a)\n\nhydrophobic\n\n15\n\nhydrophilic\n\nload: in; flood\n\nr\n\n1.0\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 0.5\n\nypublishing\n\nfriction force (N)\n\n0\n\nflat hexagon 10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\narea density of pillars ( l)\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\nS \/ S\n\n33\n\n33-avg\n\n( c)\n\n( d )\n\n1.99\n\n1.85\n\n1.71\n\n1.58\n\n1.44\n\n1.30\n\n1.16\n\n1.03\n\n0.89\n\n0.75\n\n0.61\n\nP\n\n0.47\n\nh\n\n0.34\n\nil.Trans.R.Soc.A\n\n( e)\n\n( f )\n\ncore\n\nshell\n\n\/ R = 5\/6\n\n37\n\nt\/ R = 0.1 Ri\n\n7\n\nE , v\n\nc\n\nc\n\nE , v\n\n:\n\ns\n\ns\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0190131\n\n0.7\n\nz\n\nH\n\nR\n\n\/ s avg-\n\ni\n\ns z 1\n\ncontrol\n\nt\n\nR\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 14.

It was found that a thinner layer of PDMS on the pillar end is Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nmore efficient in reducing the stress at the pillar edge, contributing to the adhesion enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, by coating a thin layer of PDMS onto the gecko-inspired T-shaped micropillar made of polyurethane acrylate (PUA) could sharply enhance the shear adhesion as compared the same structure but composed of either PDMS or PUA [65]. If the core is composed of a polymer material whose stiffness significant decreases by applying an electric current, dynamic tuning of adhesion was successfully realized by the modulation of subsurface stiffness [66].\n\n(c) Adhesion with liquid at interface\n\nThere is mucus on the toe pads of tree frogs, so that a thin layer of liquid is always present at the contact interface. Therefore, tree frog adhesion is considered as wet adhesion, compared to the dry adhesion of geckos. To mimic wet adhesion, spreading a layer of liquid on the structured surface is widely employed [60, 67,68]. The wet adhesion strength is therefore profoundly influenced\n\n\n\nmicrostructured\n\nflat\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n5\n\n50\n\n200\n\n5\n\n50\n\n200 mms\u20131\n\n16\n\nwet\n\ndry\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oy\n\n2\n\nalsociet\n\npolymer-coating\n\nypublishing\n\n1\n\nheat\n\nlow\n\nhigh\n\nadhesion force (mN)\n\nadhesion\n\nadhesion\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\ncool\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\nglycerol 99%\n\nglycerol 87%\n\nH\n\n0\n\n.org\/journal\/rsta\n\nFigure 15.

By applying glycerol (which is polar and does not evaporate ran\n\nat room temperature) to the interface, the adhesion of structured PDMS against a ruby sphere s.R\n\nwas evaluated [60]. It was found that, in the main, short-range attractive forces dominate\n\n.So\n\nadhesion when the PDMS surface is hydrophobic, as the glycerol may be squeezed out from c.A37\n\nthe contact area forming direct contacts. It therefore behaves like gecko-inspired structured 7\n\nadhesive, showing a strong dependence on the contact geometry [60]. By contrast, long-range\n\n:20190131\n\nattractive forces associated with capillarity dominate when the surface is hydrophilic. In this situation, capillary force dominates the adhesion strength, independent of the microstructures on the surface. It was suggested that the adhesion enhancement in the presence of fluid could be the result of crack arresting by liquid, in addition to the capillary forces [69]. It should be noted that excessive liquid will produce a lubrication region, leading to a reduction in adhesion and friction [69,70]. Since the surface wettability has a strong influence on wet adhesion, the switching of a surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic, e.g. by temperature, could therefore regulate the wet adhesion. By coating a layer of temperature responsive copolymer poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl acrylate-co-isopropyl acrylamide) (p(DMA-co-MEA-coNIPAAm) on PDMS micropillars, switching of underwater adhesion was successfully achieved by simply adjusting the temperature of the water bath (figure 15 b) [71].\n\nThe microstructure of the toe pads of animals like tree frogs is considered to play a very important role in wet adhesion. It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid\u2013solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72,73]. Due to the polygonal nature of frog-inspired micropatterns, shear adhesion (friction) shows orientation dependence. In our previous work, wet friction was found to be the highest along the direction of side-sliding (figure 16 a) [55]. Moreover, elongated hexagonal micropillars show an even higher friction at the same orientation. The effective arresting of cracks increases following the edge density per unit length along the friction direction, contributing to friction Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nenhancement. The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].

This means that capillary force may serve as the major contributor to wet adhesion on a rough surface [77]. Moreover, structured adhesives could effectively slow down the evaporation of liquid on the rough substrates, which is quite important for tree frogs and other animals using wet adhesion in their natural environment [38].\n\nWhile most studies of wet adhesion on artificial materials involved coating a thin layer of liquid on the structured surface, a few reported the delivery of liquid to the contact area mimicking the secretion of animals [49, 80]. Making use of the microphase separation of block copolymer poly(styrene- b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS2VP), nanopillars with 98 nm internal channels were designed to deliver liquid to the contact area, mimicking the dynamic secretion of animals.\n\nThe combination of material softening in high humidity and the transportation of mineral oil to the contact interface greatly increased the adhesion force by two orders of magnitude. The comparison of work of adhesion at different humidities suggests that the contribution of liquid Downloaded from https:\/\/royalsocietypublishing.org\/ on 09 July 2023\n\nbridges remained the same, while direct solid\u2013solid contact was 30 times higher when the relative humidity increased from 25 to 90% (figure 17 c). Interestingly, Vogel et al. [80] have designed a device with a plate full of holes. Water can be pumped into the holes via channels beneath the plate and form droplet arrays on the plate (figure 17 a). Each droplet can therefore form a liquid bridge with a contacting surface, creating an adhesion force at the interface. Indeed, with all the liquid droplets acting together, the device can generate a substantial adhesion force.\n\n4. Applications\n\nAlthough the mimicking of tree frog-inspired wet adhesion is still in its infancy, there are already some attempts to make use of it in the area of bionic robots [81], soft tissue engineering [82], etc.\n\nFor instance, Tsipenyuk prepared a variety of polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) hexagonal patterns as the stretching unit for disposable safety razors [82].

Thus, the friction force was double that of commercial products and stretched the moist skin much better. Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74]. More recently, a biomimetic skin patch inspired by the hexagonal pattern of tree frog toe pads and the convex cup of octopus suckers has been reported\n\n(figure 18 c) [83].

Conclusion and outlook\n\nypublishing\n\nIt is clear that tree frogs exhibit outstanding wet adhesion properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years, both in our understanding of how tree frogs adhere and in the development of tree frog-inspired wet adhesives. But many questions remain unanswered. For instance, while\n\n.or\n\nmost of the tree frog-mimicking studies have focused on the micropattern on the toe pad, more g\/journal\/rsta\n\nattention should be given to forming a better understanding of the role of the nanostructures.\n\nCould there be synergistic interactions between the micro- and nanostructures and the mucus?\n\nMoreover, since the animals keep secreting all the time, the liquid volume at the contacting interface should change accordingly. How will this dynamic process contribute to adhesion and P\n\nfriction during the locomotion of animals? And can we make use of the dynamic process? The hil.T\n\nanswers to these questions could deepen our understanding of the adhesion of tree frogs and ran\n\nspeed the development of applications of bioinspired wet adhesion.\n\ns.R.\n\nData accessibility.
