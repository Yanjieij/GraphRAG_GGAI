Significant warming has intensified the threat to social and economic sustainability (medium confidence). Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of the threat of heatwaves across Asia, droughts in arid and semi-arid areas of West, Central, and South Asia, delays and weakening of the monsoon circulation in South Asia, floods in monsoon regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia, and glacier melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (medium confidence). {10.3.1, 10.3.3}\n\nAsian countries are experiencing a hotter summer climate, resulting in an increase in energy demand for cooling at a rapid rate, together with population growth (high confidence). Decrease in precipitation influences energy demand as well as desalination, underground water pumping, and other energy-intensive methods increasingly used for water supply (high confidence). More energy demands in summer seasons will exceed any energy savings from relatively lower heating demand due to warmer winters. Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high-energy insecurity and industrial-systems risk (high confidence). {10.4.1}\n\nAsian terrestrial ecosystems change is driven by global warming, precipitation, and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing, and extreme events like dust storms, along with natural and human-related factors which interact (high confidence). Treeline position in North Asian mountains moved upwards after the 1990s, while in the Himalaya, treeline demonstrates a multi-directional shift\u2014either moving upwards, showing no upslope advance, or moving downwards. This can be explained by site-specific complex interactions of the positive effect of warming on tree growth, drought stress, changes in snow precipitation, land-use change (especially grazing), and other factors (high confidence). The considerable changes in biomes in Asia are a response to warming (medium confidence). Terrestrial and freshwater species, populations, and communities are altered in line with climate change across Asia (medium to high confidence). Climate change, human activity, and lightning have caused the increase in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia after the 1990s (medium confidence). Length of plant growth season has increased in some parts of East and North Asia, while the opposite trend, or no change at all, has been observed in other parts (high confidence). Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence).","chunk_id":"b61a22212865c744b92b2f734a80c931","document_ids":["5a17ca0063b3e7e0d54f197b1e67d7ff"],"n_tokens":512}

Significant warming has intensified the threat to social and economic sustainability (medium confidence). Rising temperatures increase the likelihood of the threat of heatwaves across Asia, droughts in arid and semi-arid areas of West, Central, and South Asia, delays and weakening of the monsoon circulation in South Asia, floods in monsoon regions in South, Southeast, and East Asia, and glacier melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (medium confidence). {10.3.1, 10.3.3}\n\nAsian countries are experiencing a hotter summer climate, resulting in an increase in energy demand for cooling at a rapid rate, together with population growth (high confidence). Decrease in precipitation influences energy demand as well as desalination, underground water pumping, and other energy-intensive methods increasingly used for water supply (high confidence). More energy demands in summer seasons will exceed any energy savings from relatively lower heating demand due to warmer winters. Among 13 developing countries with large energy consumption in Asia, 11 are exposed to high-energy insecurity and industrial-systems risk (high confidence). {10.4.1}\n\nAsian terrestrial ecosystems change is driven by global warming, precipitation, and Asian monsoon alteration, permafrost thawing, and extreme events like dust storms, along with natural and human-related factors which interact (high confidence). Treeline position in North Asian mountains moved upwards after the 1990s, while in the Himalaya, treeline demonstrates a multi-directional shift—either moving upwards, showing no upslope advance, or moving downwards. This can be explained by site-specific complex interactions of the positive effect of warming on tree growth, drought stress, changes in snow precipitation, land-use change (especially grazing), and other factors (high confidence). The considerable changes in biomes in Asia are a response to warming (medium confidence). Terrestrial and freshwater species, populations, and communities are altered in line with climate change across Asia (medium to high confidence). Climate change, human activity, and lightning have caused the increase in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia after the 1990s (medium confidence). Length of plant growth season has increased in some parts of East and North Asia, while the opposite trend, or no change at all, has been observed in other parts (high confidence). Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence).\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Observed biodiversity or habitat losses of animals and plants have been linked to climate change in some parts of Asia (high confidence). There is evidence that climate change can alter species interaction or spatial distribution of invasive species in Asia (high confidence). Changes in ecosystems in Asia during the 21st century are expected to be driven by projected climatic, natural, and socioeconomic changes. Across Asia, under a range of representative concentration pathways and other scenarios, rising temperatures are expected to contribute to a northward shift of biome boundaries and an upwards shift of mountain treeline (medium confidence). {10.4.2}\n\nIn this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and is typeset in italics (e.g., medium confidence). For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence.\n\nCoastal habitats of Asia are diverse, and the impacts of climate change—including rising temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise (SLR)—have brought negative effects to the services and the livelihoods of people dependent on them (high confidence). The degree of bleaching of coral reefs is diverse among different presences of stress-tolerant symbionts and higher thermal thresholds. The risk of irreversible loss of coral reefs, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, plankton communities, and other marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C temperature rise or more (high confidence). Mangroves in the region continue to face threats due to pollution, conversion for aquaculture and agriculture, and climate-based threats like SLR and coastal erosion. {10.4.3}\n\nBoth climatic and non-climatic drivers such as socioeconomic changes have created water stress conditions in both water supply and demand in all sub-regions of Asia, except for North Asia (medium confidence).

Additionally, they self-clean, so that they are resistant to failure through the accumulation of dirt particles [7–9]. Initially, work was mainly carried out P\n\non geckos [5,10,11], because they are among the heaviest animals using reversible adhesion for hil.T\n\ntheir locomotion and have an amazing ability to run across ceilings. These studies have shown ran\n\nthat adhesion is mainly (if not entirely) due to van der Waals forces, as the extremely small tips s.R\n\n(spatulae ca. 200 nm wide and 5–20 nm thick) of the highly branched adhesive setae (hairs) on\n\n.So\n\nthe toe pads of geckos are able to achieve extremely close contact with the surface to which the c.A\n\ngecko is adhering. A number of gecko-inspired adhesive structures have been designed and some 377\n\ncan support the weight of a human [12]. However, such gecko-inspired structures are difficult to\n\n:20190131\n\nmimic and their durability is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe adhesion mechanism of tree and torrent frogs is quite different, which means the biomimetic applications arising from it will differ from those developed from geckos. As will be described in this review, tree frogs mainly adhere by wet adhesion, as there is a thin layer of fluid between the toe pad and the adhering substrate. The adhesive forces are thought to be capillarity and viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces [13–15], but a role for van der Waals forces cannot be excluded [16]. Tree frog toe pads also generate friction forces; indeed, maximum friction forces may exceed those arising from adhesion [17,18]. As we shall describe, the tree frog’s adhesive mechanism provides good adhesion and friction on soft wet surfaces, and, as a result, is likely to have many important applications, particularly in the field of medicine.\n\nA significant body of work has also been carried out on insects. Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Insects may have hairy pads like geckos (e.g. beetles and flies) or smooth pads like tree frogs (e.g. cockroaches and grasshoppers) [19]. As there is fluid between pad and external surface, it has, until recently, been assumed that insects, like tree frogs, adhere by wet adhesion. However, Labonte & Federle [20]\n\nhave recently questioned this conclusion as their most recent data could be better explained by adhesion using van der Waals forces.\n\nIn this short review, we will discuss the complexities of the structure of tree frog toe pads in relation to their function as well as the development of artificial toe pad analogues.

Tree/torrent frog adhesion\n\n(a) Toe-pad structure and function\n\nAdhesive toe pads are thought to have evolved separately by convergent evolution in several different families of frogs [21].

This frog 7:2\n\nhas just landed on a bamboo stem, and has slipped downwards, leaving behind some of the watery fluid that forms its adhesive 0190131\n\njoint ( b) (Allan L, 2013, personal communication).\n\nthe ventral surface of the toes (toe pads), with related structures (sub-articular tubercles) being located on the ventral surface of more proximal digits. The latter is mainly used in attachment to small diameter structures such as twigs [22]. Features important to the functioning of the toe pads are highlighted below:\n\nGrooves surround each toe pad ( circumferal and proximal grooves). These grooves (shown in\n\nfigure 2 b) will divert water around the pad in the wet environments (e.g. rain forests) in which the majority of tree frog species live. Such structures are particularly important in torrent frogs, which would otherwise be washed downstream by the water that covers the rocks on which they are found [24].\n\nThe toe pads are epithelial structures, consisting of several layers of cells [14, 25,26]. Their development can be clearly seen by the examination of transverse sections of the toes, where the deepest layers are the least specialized and the outermost the fully developed pad cells. At intervals, the outermost layer is shed, the layer beneath becoming the new surface layer (figure 3).\n\nIn this way, the frog can maintain fully functional toe pads throughout its adult life.\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nToe pads are extremely soft structures, aiding close contact to external surfaces and enhancing both adhesion and friction. Indentation experiments using spherical indenters of 264 and 1500 µm diameter [27] show a gradient of elastic modulus from 4 to 25 kPa, the higher values being found in the outermost, keratinized, layers. Such low values for the elastic modulus are comparable to sea anemone mesoglea or jellyfish jelly ( E ≈ 3 kPa [28]). The elastic modulus of a surface can also be calculated from force/distance curves produced by an AFM indenter [29]. Using this method, estimates of the elastic modulus of the external surface of the pad (the method does not provide information\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

As described below, they are mainly hexagonal in shape and are surrounded by deep, fluid-filled channels (figure 2 c). These channels are thought to serve two functions. First, they help spread the fluid over the entire pad surface, so that there are no air pockets that would reduce adhesion. Second, under wet conditions, they would help to get rid of excess fluid which would reduce adhesion by increasing the separation of pad and surface.

There are thus two sets of structures (the cells separated by grooves and the nanopillars) that allow the pad to keep close contact to rough as well as smooth surfaces, promoting both adhesion and friction forces.\n\nThe watery pad fluid has a viscosity of 1.25–1.51 mPa s−1. Using a laser tweezer technique, Federle et al. [23] have shown that the fluid secreted by the toe pads has a low viscosity in the range 1.25–1.51 mPa s−1 (figure 5). It is usually referred to as mucus, but detailed chemistry remains to be identified. It is secreted by glands within the toes and passes to the pad surface through narrow ducts which open into the grooves that separate the pad epithelial cells. It completely fills the space below the pad and forms a meniscus around the edge of the pad, producing capillary forces [14, 32]. The fluid is, however, known to contain molecules that act as surfactants Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\n[33], lowering surface tension and thus allowing capillary adhesion to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic surfaces (e.g. surfaces of waxy leaves).\n\nThe fluid layer below each epithelial cell has a thickness of the order of a few nanometres. Federle et al.\n\n[23], using interference reflection microscopy, have shown that the fluid under the toe pads has a low thickness, except around the edges of the epithelial cells, where the channels between the epithelial cells are located (figure 6). This means that, in addition to capillary forces, substantial velocity-dependent hydrodynamic forces will be present [34]. Indeed, torrent frogs can adhere in running water when the pads are completely submerged, a situation where capillary forces would be absent [35,36].\n\nTree frog toe pads produce higher friction than adhesive forces, a surprising finding for a fluid joint.\n\nFederle et al. [23] have shown that it is due to the nanopillars, which form extremely close contact with the external surface (in the range 0–5 nm (figure 6 d)). Nanopillars cover the surface of all the pad epithelial cells (figures 2 and 4), but are absent from other, non-adhesive areas\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

A common model that has been used for quantifying capillary forces consists of a sphere on a plane surface, connected by a drop of liquid (figure 7). In this model, appropriate as toe pads are slightly domed, the surface tension of the meniscus results in a pressure difference, where the pressure inside the liquid is lower than it is outside, so long as the meniscus is concave. This pressure difference, the Laplace pressure, will resist the separation of the two surfaces. The attractive Laplace force for a macroscopic, perfectly smooth and homogeneous sphere in contact with a plane is given by\n\nFL = −2 πRγ (cos θ 1 + cos θ 2),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the sphere, γ is the surface tension of the liquid, and θ 1 and θ 2 are the contact angles of the liquid with the plane surface and sphere, respectively. If the liquid completely wets both surfaces (i.e. θ 1 and θ 2 both equal 0), equation (2.1) simplifies to FL = −4 πRγ .\n\n(2.2)\n\nAn alternative model examines capillary forces between two rigid plates, separated by a thin layer of fluid (figure 8).

The mathematical equations relate the capillary attraction between the bodies to their elastic repulsion. Although they do not lend themselves to any easy calculation of the adhesive force, they are of interest in that they predict that FM scaling will gradually change from length scaling to area scaling with increasing r, this change occurring more rapidly for materials with a lower effective elastic modulus ( E eff).\n\nFor instance, in equation (2.7) which deals with the Laplace pressure component of adhesion, the first term is proportional to r and is identical to the force with a hard sphere (equation (2.4)), while the second term is proportional to r 2. It is negligible for high Young’s moduli, but becomes significant for soft materials.\n\nπγ 3\n\nFL = −4 πrγ −\n\n· 2 r 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 r\n\n3( E eff)2\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the meniscus.\n\n10\n\nWet adhesion—viscous forces.

Tree frogs are good climbers, many tropical species being found high in the canopy of rain forests. On effectively flat surfaces (e.g. smooth tree trunks), adhesion is the only means by which tree frogs can climb without falling, but on smaller diameter structures (e.g. small stems/twigs), they can additionally climb using adduction forces by grasping around these structures with their digits [22]. Indeed, as Hill et al. describe, climbing is rapid on small diameter smooth surfaces because adduction and adhesion act together, and the subarticular tubercles are also brought into play. Unlike geckos, tree frogs cannot run across a ceiling, but they can climb vertical and overhanging surfaces, and a small tree frog can hang on to an inverted glass plate using just its toe pads [32]. At rest, thigh and belly skin aid adhesion.\n\nQuantitative measurements of the adhesive forces that can be generated by tree frogs have been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14].

Since frogs have an area-based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these toe pads can be calculated (figure 11 d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is statistically significant ( r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]\n\ndemonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of\n\n\n\n\n\n( a)\n\n( b)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n11\n\n)2\n\nr\n\n............................................................... oya\n\n10\n\n100\n\nlsociet\n\nypublishing\n\nmass (g\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Both friction and adhesion components of the resultant force are shown for a 70° pull-off, which followed a short initial slide, designed to ensure good initial contact of pad and force plate. A drop of water was then gently added, covering the pad in such a way that the meniscus around the edge of the pad was abolished. As expected, adhesive forces fell to low levels, but recovered following removal of the water (not shown). What was not expected was that friction forces declined as well. The only possible conclusion, supported by subsequent experiments examining the effects of the procedure on the thickness of the fluid layer under the pad using interference reflection microscopy, was that this simple procedure had increased the pad–ground distance. Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Such a change would of course also have reduced adhesion from viscosity-dependent hydrodynamic forces, and also molecular interactions (e.g. van der Waals forces) that depended on close contact of pad and surface. The experiment is, however, interesting, even though it did not confirm the dominant role of capillarity that it was intended to test. This is because it demonstrates another, equally Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nimportant role for capillary forces in holding the pad close enough to the ground to allow the other forces to exert their adhesive action.\n\nA second interesting result resulting from single pad force recordings comes from the work of Federle et al. [23] in which friction forces were recorded during a short horizontal pull.\n\nSince friction forces developed before the pad began to slide and, additionally, there was a\n\n‘remaining’ friction force 2 min after the slide was completed, it is clear that toe pads can generate static friction, strongly suggesting that, during such times, there is actual contact between structures on the toe pads (presumably the nanopillars) and the force plate.\n\nFinally, as has been made clear from the above, these miniature force plates are particularly suitable for measuring the maximum adhesive and friction forces that tree frog toe pads can produce, since both the maximum force and the area of contact are easy to measure. In the gliding frog, Rhacophorus dennysi, the calculated values were 1.45 ± 1.14 mN mm−2 ( N = 33) for adhesive force and 6.21 ± 5.11 mN mm−2 ( N = 24) for friction [17]. This result supports one of the main\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusions of Langowski et al.

CNT-based adhesives showed shear adhesion of approximately 100 N cm−2, 10 times higher than that of gecko foot-hairs [46]. The complicated fabrication process and the poor durability of CNT forest, however, hinder its future applications. By contrast, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has a relatively low modulus, has been widely used to construct structured adhesives due to its handling simplicity and commercial availability.\n\nCompared to the flat surface, PDMS micropillar arrays showed a remarkable decrease in E eff, so that a larger AR results in a smaller E eff (figure 13 a, b). The decreased E eff results in a higher compliance to the contact surface, causing a higher elastic energy dissipation during pull-off from the surface [52]. For instance, increasing the AR of PDMS micropillar arrays from 0.5 to 4 increased pull-off forces by a factor of 3 [53]. It is worth mentioning that measurement of the E eff of a pillar array with a small AR (e.g. 0.5) could be influenced by its backing material. However, higher ARs are not always beneficial for adhesion enhancement. In the case of frog-inspired hexagonal pillars Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nwith height of H and side length of L (figure 13 c), the adhesion force was found to decrease when H/ L was increased from 0.75 to approximately 1.9 (figure 13 d) [54]. Similar adhesion dependence on the pillar AR was also reported by Iturri [55]. It was explained that the pillars tend to bend and cluster at a high AR, due to the small gap between pillars. The bending and clustering may contribute to the adhesion reduction in two possible ways: (1) the bending of pillars offers the pillar edge for contact, reducing the effective contact area; (2) the clustering of pillars may form a continuous area for contact, reducing the effect of contact splitting. Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads,\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

Moreover, the contact density will be reduced by increasing the channel width W, resulting in a smaller adhesive force. This may explain why tree frog toe pads have a small pillar height and a small channel width.\n\nThough the adhesive toe pads on tree frogs and bush-crickets are normally called smooth adhesive pads, the pillar tops are never smooth. As described above, concave nanostructures have been found on the toe pads of tree frogs (figure 4), and peg-structures have also been reported in bush-crickets [56]. Li et al.

( a, b) reproduced from Greiner et al. [52]; ( c, d) are reproduced from Wang et al. [53].\n\nmicro-bulges on pillar top prepared by combining hemispheric crater arrays on SiO2 wafer and conventional photolithography. The increased friction force of this hierarchical hexagonal structure, especially in the hydrophilic state, demonstrated the importance of nanostructures on toe pads of tree frogs (figure 14 b). Moreover, concave, spatular, T-shape and spherical micropillar tops were also constructed to investigate the adhesion properties. T-shape pillars, prepared by conventional moulding [59] and inking–printing–curing (IPC) methods, exhibited maximum adhesion strength, both in wet [60] and dry [48, 61] conditions. Both the higher compliance and comparatively large contact area contribute to the outstanding performance. Furthermore, the crack initiation tends to start from the centre during the detachment [62], which results in a suction effect, contributing positively to the adhesion [59].\n\nDownloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\n(b) Influences of micro- and nanostructure\n\nInspired by the existence of nanopillars in toe pad of tree frogs, we fabricated a composite structure with aligned polystyrene (PS) nanopillars embedded in soft PDMS hexagonal micropillars [63]. Both adhesion and friction forces were greatly enhanced compared to the structure with pure PDMS. The finite-element simulation suggests that the embedded nanopillars could regulate the stress distribution across the contact interface, with the stress maximum being distributed on top of a row of nanopillars close to the micropillar perimeter (but not at the centre of contact area or at the very edge of the pillar; figure 14 d). This is similar to the T-shape pillars inspired by gecko setae, which can also shift the stress maximum to the centre of the contact area, inhibiting the crack initiation during pulling. However, the composite structure should possess a much higher stability and durability since the nanopillars are embedded.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n\n( b)\n\n( a)\n\nhydrophobic\n\n15\n\nhydrophilic\n\nload: in; flood\n\nr\n\n1.0\n\n............................................................... oyalsociet 0.5\n\nypublishing\n\nfriction force\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

[71].\n\nPhil.T\n\nby the surface wettability [35, 60]. By applying glycerol (which is polar and does not evaporate ran\n\nat room temperature) to the interface, the adhesion of structured PDMS against a ruby sphere s.R\n\nwas evaluated [60]. It was found that, in the main, short-range attractive forces dominate\n\n.So\n\nadhesion when the PDMS surface is hydrophobic, as the glycerol may be squeezed out from c.A37\n\nthe contact area forming direct contacts. It therefore behaves like gecko-inspired structured 7\n\nadhesive, showing a strong dependence on the contact geometry [60]. By contrast, long-range\n\n:20190131\n\nattractive forces associated with capillarity dominate when the surface is hydrophilic. In this situation, capillary force dominates the adhesion strength, independent of the microstructures on the surface. It was suggested that the adhesion enhancement in the presence of fluid could be the result of crack arresting by liquid, in addition to the capillary forces [69]. It should be noted that excessive liquid will produce a lubrication region, leading to a reduction in adhesion and friction [69,70]. Since the surface wettability has a strong influence on wet adhesion, the switching of a surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic, e.g. by temperature, could therefore regulate the wet adhesion. By coating a layer of temperature responsive copolymer poly(dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl acrylate-co-isopropyl acrylamide) (p(DMA-co-MEA-coNIPAAm) on PDMS micropillars, switching of underwater adhesion was successfully achieved by simply adjusting the temperature of the water bath (figure 15 b) [71].\n\nThe microstructure of the toe pads of animals like tree frogs is considered to play a very important role in wet adhesion. It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid–solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72\n######################\nOutput:'}], 'model': 'mistral-nemo', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 8192, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

It is suggested that the microchannels between pillars can effectively drain liquid out from the contact area, maximizing the effective solid–solid contact\n\n[55, 67,72,73]. Due to the polygonal nature of frog-inspired micropatterns, shear adhesion (friction) shows orientation dependence. In our previous work, wet friction was found to be the highest along the direction of side-sliding (figure 16 a) [55]. Moreover, elongated hexagonal micropillars show an even higher friction at the same orientation. The effective arresting of cracks increases following the edge density per unit length along the friction direction, contributing to friction Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 09 July 2023\n\nenhancement. The theory was demonstrated by a macroscopic experiment, where the frog-inspired patterns were mounted on metal pieces and allowed to slide on a rotating surface covered with water (figure 16 c). However, Cheng et al. reported a contradictory result that the wet friction of corner-sliding was higher in both hexagonal and rhomboid pillar arrays [74]. Using Chinese ink as the indicator, the liquid squeezing out of the contact interface was found to be more effective in the direction of corner-sliding (figure 16 a). In the direction of side-sliding, liquid may flow into the contact interface due to the tilting of pillars and the flow pattern, resulting in decreased friction [74]. Recently, distinctive arch-shaped structures (figure 16 b) were reported to provide even larger wet friction force than tree frog-inspired hexagonal patterns, due to their optimal drainage effect and the high stiffness of the patterns [75]. This offers new possibilities for the design of wet adhesives in future.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the bioinspired wet adhesive exhibits better performance on rough than smooth substrates [76,77].

This means that capillary force may serve as the major contributor to wet adhesion on a rough surface [77]. Moreover, structured adhesives could effectively slow down the evaporation of liquid on the rough substrates, which is quite important for tree frogs and other animals using wet adhesion in their natural environment [38].\n\nWhile most studies of wet adhesion on artificial materials involved coating a thin layer of liquid on the structured surface, a few reported the delivery of liquid to the contact area mimicking the secretion of animals [49, 80]. Making use of the microphase separation of block copolymer poly(styrene- b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS2VP), nanopillars with 98 nm internal channels were designed to deliver liquid to the contact area, mimicking the dynamic secretion of animals.\n\nThe combination of material softening in high humidity and the transportation of mineral oil to the contact interface greatly increased the adhesion force by two orders of magnitude.

Interestingly, Vogel et al. [80] have designed a device with a plate full of holes. Water can be pumped into the holes via channels beneath the plate and form droplet arrays on the plate (figure 17 a). Each droplet can therefore form a liquid bridge with a contacting surface, creating an adhesion force at the interface. Indeed, with all the liquid droplets acting together, the device can generate a substantial adhesion force.\n\n4. Applications\n\nAlthough the mimicking of tree frog-inspired wet adhesion is still in its infancy, there are already some attempts to make use of it in the area of bionic robots [81], soft tissue engineering [82], etc.\n\nFor instance, Tsipenyuk prepared a variety of polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) hexagonal patterns as the stretching unit for disposable safety razors [82].

Also, Chen et al. prepared PDMS polygonal arrays and applied them to the gripping surface of surgical graspers (figure 18 b). Compared to the traditional tooth-textured surgical grasper, the new design can greatly reduce the gripping force, reducing damage to soft tissue [74].
